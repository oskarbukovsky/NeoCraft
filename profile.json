Mekanism is an *experience* that will forever change the way you play Minecraft.\n\nHere at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you’ll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‘mining’ and ‘crafting’ and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.\n\nYou may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you’re wasting the majority of what you’ve mined. Mekanism’s team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even *quintuple* your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.\n\nOur engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you’ve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even *walls* of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.\n\nJust a few of the many reasons Mekanism will be the highlight of your Minecraft experience:\n- Hydrogen-powered **Jetpacks**, with multiple togglable flight modes\n- A small, cute, and loyal robotic friend (**Robit**!) to follow you around\n- A **Digital Miner** with state-of-the-art filtering technologies to automate your mining needs\n- A **Fusion Reactor** which uses advanced [internal confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) technology to harness the power of the sun to run advanced machinery (*requires Mekanism Generators*)\n- Various transmitters for transferring items, fluids, gases, energy, and even heat!\n- An effective machinery configuration system, which allows for the creation of advanced item transport networks capable of sorting and filtering (using our patented **Logistical Transporters**!)\n\nLinks to other Mekanism modules:\n- [Mekanism Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-additions)\n- [Mekanism Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-generators)\n- [Mekanism Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-tools)\n\n<br>\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** playing Mekanism with CyanideX's Unity: Dark Edition resource pack.\n- [Unity: Dark Edition](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity-dark-edition/)\n- [Classic Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity/)","published":"2022-05-27T00:12:09.740488Z","updated":"2024-03-24T17:32:02.074815Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":149257,"followers":241,"categories":["equipment","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gqJMEABX","wukmoSeF","4QWCUteA","ruRBKgwc","KIzASRO5","dZZ4j18G","4IEoyWzh","IDjtJsDR","ZrS7qENE","nDxFueG2","DlhxRTKL","atcAq1UT","Pz4thLN2","ppz3xziS","g74zfl0m","RGlXXgcD","zWt8Aemn","zLHaraw3","yDOSRo2r","6zqf3EGe","OFopgIFW","xKRR7R7a","RBifwW3R","TAyUJAKw","X58zIngK","CgFgCgTf","yj7d33HE","MLG4wWo6","W5PUUWt9","GxZSvUQi","5fXP0XBe","52nOMLHi","gNIc57RO","eVOeDNA3","aYZg5gr4","ITHqRXF6","H8bgSedJ","JzPscbhA","nKXR4Epk","JorNeGyn","SsMYCLyo","ymNS7Xu4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"zWt8Aemn","project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","author_id":"81DWsUKb","featured":false,"name":"10.2.5.465","version_number":"10.2.5.465","changelog":"<a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/16d8c6adda4dfabdc7108e7413c6825dc9df0684\">16d8c6a</a> - Fix induction cells exposing an energy capability <a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/7552\">#7552</a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/a395dafc0ebe46c0e2cc0cd2c98edbbcf9f5a61a\">a395daf</a> - Bump version to 10.2.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-07-14T23:44:20.077347Z","downloads":11488,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"86248728732c1877cdc281695f67cbd7d6727e28","sha512":"c9067e5829ff950d7b7ebd0cc7a24b161a3d1b29cc0b008d8744adbec05d890c152dca0884c13675a868bde09971b58c8e1410590d12d02d257600f2b9aaa1a4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/versions/10.2.5.465/Mekanism-1.18.2-10.2.5.465.jar","filename":"Mekanism-1.18.2-10.2.5.465.jar","primary":true,"size":11619466,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"89b867a4e899437493a0069bd3be33e18d23c8eb","sha512":"e06e9e7b6dbd42b3c1554f0a5884532033f37a409546f05f022b61084ea6721cd3d39c00503f91de5e10dcf9c93a6d1ffeaaa41fe4ddfb2cf904fb65617d437c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/versions/10.2.5.465/Mekanism-1.18.2-10.2.5.465-api.jar","filename":"Mekanism-1.18.2-10.2.5.465-api.jar","primary":false,"size":411880,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"qf2Yz73T","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"bcOsQHnC","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"fmRxKFx2","project_id":"gu7yAYhd","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"EU5OONA2","project_id":"uE1WpIAk","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"td7tkc0C","user":{"id":"LyyFcgkG","username":"CyanideX","name":"CyanideX","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3106700?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-31T17:07:01.695675Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"td7tkc0C","user":{"id":"YLZi3fFh","username":"Ridanisaurus","name":"Kal Chikhou","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64355028?v=4","bio":"Amature Minecraft Modder, and pixel art hobbyist.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-03-04T10:40:46.719822Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":979187,"followers":1511,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"q0CGibTg","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.18+] Mouse Tweaks 2.22","version_number":"1.18-2.22-forge","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Replay Mod.\n- Changed how RMBTweak works to support Bundles and Bundle-like mod items.\n- RMB-dragging a Bundle with RMBTweak will \"right click\" items out of a Bundle into the slots as you're dragging over them.\n- RMB-dragging with a Bundle over items will now pick the items up into the Bundle.\n- Enabled RMBTweak by default again.\n- Added a config menu accessible from the Mods menu in Forge and from Mod Menu in Fabric.\n- Adjusted inventory-position-aware scrolling type to be a bit more intuitive.

It will also let you know what tool parts are missing or incorrect for completing the craft.\n\n![Showcase of \"starring\" a tool blueprint](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/311778022086803456/1059405989025153044/star.png)\n\nThis mod is also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-planner/)!","published":"2023-01-02T04:44:38.660276Z","updated":"2023-01-02T09:07:45.635866Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3290,"followers":22,"categories":["equipment","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["EepGW0lL","rZ0aiD6j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XYufjdjs/73e1e3d21d034679786ad71812f1bea11fab9f84.png"},"version":{"id":"rZ0aiD6j","project_id":"XYufjdjs","author_id":"rJAlXtEt","featured":true,"name":"1.2.0","version_number":"1.18.2-1.2.0","changelog":"- Port to 1.18.2\n\n- Contains all changes in 1.2.0 for 1.16.5\n\n- Modifiers now show their icons (1.18 only)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-01-02T09:07:46.621546Z","downloads":1776,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"de5169601fd0eb60995fd7a04f66ba204febdc7b48cc342885d4d5bfa58159d60769955d04a5a4d991275b0c7d087a23872a0f9e26dfa932839fc13b8e69efb9","sha1":"33205a348854308b5d015b512ae5a7c5e7075317"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XYufjdjs/versions/rZ0aiD6j/tconplanner-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar","filename":"tconplanner-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":121880,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"rtqDbRrV","project_id":"rxIIYO6c","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"99HlZ1W1","user":{"id":"uY9qY2wP","username":"SpikyStars","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56983047?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-01-02T08:48:39.854249Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"99HlZ1W1","user":{"id":"rJAlXtEt","username":"tiffit","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10173431?v=4","bio":":3","created":"2023-01-02T04:42:14.644492Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"tconplanner-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar"},"mods\\FluxNetworks-1.18.2-7.0.9.15.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"45bef4e3bd70d5dca531155ea61979de5f9d47d4bcb2ec69c04635be210652e8ce6963eb35c5c5e523dff570d50bf988ff572aa5bdafd85c9b3ecedbf2745a14","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Flux Networks","description":"    Wireless Energy Networks\n    ","authors":["Sonar Sonic, BloCamLimb"],"version":"7.0.9.15","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"FluxNetworks-1.18.2-7.0.9.15.jar.disabled"},"mods\\rubidium-0.5.6.jar":{"sha512":"319544d55243db3955d19a2978c8378f4bc72496208aff31e6c622f63bd100e84caf06f94f6838b27af7768fd2712c721017d9ee76190d2e0349f43a6cb6a22f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4ZqxOvjD","slug":"rubidium","project_type":"mod","team":"CsqDoH4a","title":"Rubidium","description":"Unofficial Fork of CaffeineMC's \"Sodium\", made to work with FML","body":"## **Rubidium is an Unofficial Fork of CaffeineMC's \"Sodium\", made to work with Forge Mod Loader.**\n\n\n# Features\n\nRubidium contains all the features of the classic Sodium.\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n  \n- A modern OpenGL rendering pipeline for chunk rendering that takes advantage of multi-draw techniques, allowing for a significant reduction in CPU overhead (~90%) when rendering the world. This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n  \n</details>","published":"2022-07-02T09:36:53.033379Z","updated":"2023-09-24T21:04:19.380872Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":515317,"followers":392,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["52gcrxOy","suKMGRbi","V7JZgyIU","TnN4CV2Q","c4RHSmo9","WTmxKPaw","ibGbqBbP","w6asrex4","JEoSJNGo","v1Byy3O4","qSw3a67v","ySmWhbfP","QrS8ZpUH","lCbMhmSa","Hlexif59","uqcWRM8W","9DCa1IzX","6YKudvQ5","vkRZleVy","iLEHOlRR","17IcFh9q","KoZMxzwB","YDAuLUY8","bmmEZ4mh","VKligEsm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"9DCa1IzX","project_id":"4ZqxOvjD","author_id":"OGBzw79h","featured":false,"name":"Rubidium mc1.18.2-0.5.6","version_number":"0.5.6","changelog":"### Fixed Chunk rendering with Immersive Engineering (thanks to malte0811)\n\nParity with Forge on rendering block sides (thanks to Su5eD)\n\nFixed crash when disabling fast_biome_colors option (thanks to alcatrazEscapee)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-17T11:39:11.294190Z","downloads":58029,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"319544d55243db3955d19a2978c8378f4bc72496208aff31e6c622f63bd100e84caf06f94f6838b27af7768fd2712c721017d9ee76190d2e0349f43a6cb6a22f","sha1":"1ce63fa6642a71b2e1b175bbdc0f61ac12669a67"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/versions/9DCa1IzX/rubidium-0.5.6.jar","filename":"rubidium-0.5.6.jar","primary":true,"size":1342466,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CsqDoH4a","user":{"id":"OGBzw79h","username":"Asek3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613894?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-02T09:26:04.535310Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rubidium-0.5.6.jar"},"mods\\ScalableCatsForce-2.13.10-build-12-with-library.jar":{"sha512":"023be350f46908abc779ef45ba9ac9a727d0a66d8bbc4ba7c1614a5efae07ff12ab416cfb7882ed4c253c9ad167bc9e9ac3df493b3cad1d6a547f82abf307f7d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"zr0QMQMo","slug":"scalable-cats-force","project_type":"mod","team":"rWrSRhdh","title":"Scalable Cat's Force","description":"Scala library for mods for forge","body":"This is a library for mods written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).\n\nThe forge library contained Scala runtime until 1.12, but it was removed in 1.13.\n\nThis library contains Scala runtime and Cats, which is a library for functional programming.\n* Scala(https://www.scala-lang.org/) is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-02-28T19:40:53.632594Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":225405,"followers":91,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"ge8ra0kG","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 1.11.3","version_number":"1.11.3","changelog":"release for 1.18.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T17:07:17.605106Z","downloads":20534,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ca5d46c752f10dae0d77d41a52527f6eacd1895e","sha512":"e68dc01266a887238e2f26fba9534d78be6d816b34985c3d84a924f8110c1cb88d59f943e9be60900323985d4bab13f8d73f23afea02cc8a0b1b3050448df1c6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/ge8ra0kG/citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar","filename":"citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":503137,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-1.11.3-1.18.2.jar.disabled"},"mods\\modernfix-forge-5.14.0+mc1.18.2.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"798de1677ff78cc7b5a0772a52bf76504b4744c77916751a7e969793b1de72eb71929879b7746857f502bfbea526719bc9f20ff942d57452b67c7d447070cf3b","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nmDcB62a","slug":"modernfix","project_type":"mod","team":"xw684WUq","title":"ModernFix","description":"All-in-one mod that improves performance, reduces memory usage, and fixes many bugs.

However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

We decided to decouple\nthe Requester features from it and make it a standalone mod.\n\nThe whole system has been rewritten and also supports fluids now!\n\n## **⏰ Changelog**\nEverything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].\n\n## **🎓 License**\nThis project is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0][license].\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[minecraft]: https://www.minecraft.net/\n[ae2]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2\n[forge]: http://files.minecraftforge.net/\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net/\n[lazier ae2]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazierae2\n[releases]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/releases\n[changelog]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/blob/1.19-forge/CHANGELOG.md\n[license]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/blob/1.19-forge/LICENSE\n","published":"2022-10-13T20:37:59.905410Z","updated":"2023-08-24T19:30:29.256401Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":44473,"followers":41,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["LTjh3jCo","8aPEeRK1","2g5yXXfo","8ZlwBDja","hPBX6OFM","LjC6fzjt","gdVNYc3w","1tUtT2kT","MaYvvIfF","S1pvGtSC","xhYm4qsF","gkZRWAzf","T9IIKg4d","yXwR4OMH","uUlsGO6e","g2VNuFdH","h4N5WziD","cJJwuk7j","lZ70idk9","q7qVs8KA","cw9oZEFo","k2JdDVWj","Gg3mZoOc","foRgIoXY","LteQ5iG9","EQUaRI0m","N0ZIW5Y9","GogaQgNr","NmhR6jIY","ehPc0G14"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/E6BFl96N/4024be522db82e28c63552475f3289809d3bb34d.png"},"version":{"id":"q7qVs8KA","project_id":"E6BFl96N","author_id":"qtbuSRQ6","featured":true,"name":"MERequester-Forge-1.18.2-1.1.2","version_number":"1.18.2-1.1.2+forge","changelog":"### Added\n- ability to copy-paste settings with the Memory Card ([#12])\n- simplified Chinese translation ([#13])\n\n### Fixed\n- ME Requester disconnecting from network after server restart ([#14])\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[#12]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/issues/12\n[#13]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/pull/13\n[#14]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/issues/14\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-22T20:53:46.414601Z","downloads":854,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7f9563c7924d17cc6427d77df7540d1c183c8179a9f0dc6c62875929b889f6044ba2b396b968c8810c2524386b097b9ef01dd58801f2c12794e8ecc1deb7519e","sha1":"1e0a2316e31e1fb6214e838644a4667e8c0e8cf2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/E6BFl96N/versions/q7qVs8KA/merequester-1.18.2-1.1.2.jar","filename":"merequester-1.18.2-1.1.2.jar","primary":true,"size":169748,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"7mmL0PW9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"},{"version_id":"qf2Yz73T","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HWUMHTN8","user":{"id":"qtbuSRQ6","username":"Relentless","name":"Relentless","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16513358?v=4","bio":"Hobby developer mostly developing bots or mods.","created":"2022-02-28T01:07:44.015749Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"merequester-1.18.2-1.1.2.jar"},"mods\\CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.18.2-1.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"97c99b0a5c6c4658b4a3a8c0ae1c454de60d7c63214d745cc38964ab5bc45f10b86b1011a01ec3fd8ea7240a6258f8771d09c219ef6f6786d51ff863187633c3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qthuEuVy","slug":"cull-less-leaves-reforged","project_type":"mod","team":"pYMej8BZ","title":"Cull Less Leaves Reforged","description":"Gives you a 9% fps improvement for leaves rendering","body":"######   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ModLoader:%20Forge-lightgrey)  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Minecraft%201.18.2,%201.19.2-green)  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-More%20versions%20are%20work%20in%20progress-informational) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Client%20Mod%20-critical)\n\n**Cull Less Leaves Reforged is a unoffical Forge port of Cull Less Leaves:**(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-less-leaves).\n\nThis mod gives you a **9% fps improvement for rendering leaves.**\n\n**Join my discord for support, suggestions and discussion with others**\n\n###### [![](https://img.shields.io/discord/1087408974271357040?color=7289DA&label=Discord&logo=discord&logoColor=FFFFFF)](https://discord.com/invite/TEub2vQfhF)\n\n**Important Notice:** I will only support the last two major release versions of Minecraft for all of my mods (that's currently 1.18.2 and 1.19.2).\n\n#### 📢 **Looking for more performance mods?

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

(v1.14~)\\\n    ![CPU usage indication](https://i.imgur.com/CkuuwJj.png)\n\n## Recommended in the following cases\n- When leaving the game running without the operation, for example with automated agriculture and/or industry.\n- When doing other work concurrently with running Minecraft in background.\n- When you want to extend the lifespan of your PC even a little.\n- When you want to save unnecessary power.\n- When the room is hot...\n\n## Usage\nBy default, if there is no operation for 5 minutes the frame rate will drop to 10.\\\nPressing [PAUSE] key reduces FPS manually. (new feature in v1.16)\\\nPressing [END] key opens the configuration GUI by default.\\\n![Mod configuration GUI](https://i.imgur.com/aHob2HN.jpg)\n\n## Note\nThis is a client-side mod, so it is not necessary to install it on the server.\n\n## Modpacks\nFeel free to use this mod in any modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n- Thanks to RoCoKo for Turkish translations.\n- Thanks to Grreg21 for Polish translations.\n- Thanks to cutedobe and StarsShine17423 for Simplified Chinese translation.\n- Thanks to cutedobe and StarsShine17423 for Traditional Chinese translation.\n- Thanks to agent_rby_ for Russian translation.\n- Thanks to b14st0 for French translation.\n- Thanks to Kazuya79H for Brazilian Portuguese translation.\n- Thanks to AlexDerProGamer_mc for German translation.\n- Thanks to 귤러리 for Korean translation.\n- Thanks to AceDragoonOfficial for Ukrainian translation.\n- Thanks to Giedo for Dutch translation.\n- Thanks to iwafflebro for Spanish translation.","published":"2023-09-06T12:46:51.493326Z","updated":"2023-12-20T09:45:52.228089Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":261757,"followers":180,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["KkQ36LBj","zbiYRGSH","ipev7TSy","qLmjdp42","kllCOntS","UX5XQGgU","42sbHeZ4","FfeCLQH6","vV1qiHKp","f10384wU","OXfcKJ36","1oFpbo8m","weEcLV93","jV2DSnzl","NC42KeY2","N8HANFRr","PzNcUmMG","2ahPJjgc","4dXXFcc2","EU9Ig76K","NDotOSiO","XP4qT1Vo","i4klNdvx","3rW1ES3Q","6kku6D0I","Hfg7u1jT","DKf2Lu0n","DKt1FRki","KMg9bw66"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iZ10HXDj/76035bb35978b1ffc16394ffe4ee6edf58c292ac.png"},"version":{"id":"jV2DSnzl","project_id":"iZ10HXDj","author_id":"c9EEp7Fr","featured":false,"name":"FPS Reducer forge 1.18.2-2.0","version_number":"1.18.2-2.0","changelog":"v2.0\n- Added new feature \"Reduce FPS in Game Menu\".\n- Added new feature \"Max FPS without action\".

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/uRKrnbH)__\n\n__Changelog: [Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/main/thermal/changelog.md)__\n\n---\n\nThe Foundation of a Thermally-enhanced world!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains both \"Core\" and \"Foundation\" - a collection of common components, resources, and tools.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3212713,"followers":4676,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"fs07zE6w","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"4.2.2 (Forge)","version_number":"4.2.2","changelog":"- Fix crash when the working directory of the game does not match the instance directory\n- On Fabric this was fixed in 1.17, so there is no Fabric equivalent of this build","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-08T16:32:48.437770Z","downloads":54651,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e9e0e711de47112dc53e24dc008da1f598834c4f","sha512":"3452a34a3dcbe630e881feb553ff55077a8dc8a25872777671242ad7da2c6d3588b9627cdb7396f049d674a1fca54026f885da171a999a0c33111ce09bd97b58"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/fs07zE6w/ferritecore-4.2.2-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-4.2.2-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":116626,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-4.2.2-forge.jar"},"mods\\PackagedAuto-1.18.2-3.1.8.38.jar":{"sha512":"cc124ce43856135a6a8e0bbd19fe20e0079c5638ccc2634e6c78f3d3b494bfa0f91866a496a657d70bd907d3fccc4ba6c9d07fd00245f9285fda4b27ebb8067e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ugIdhQx4","slug":"packagedauto","project_type":"mod","team":"vPyXtMZk","title":"PackagedAuto","description":"Enhancing Autocrafting with Packages","body":"<p>PackagedAuto is an addon to <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2\">Applied Energistics 2</a>, and it aims to use \"packages\" of items to allow autocrafting with more than 9 items, and for 1.18.1+, fluid crafting is also supported.

However, [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Rubidium]() brought it back so we need to fix it again.\n\n⚠️ Keep in mind that the fix is somehow breaking and will impact FPS. If you encounter performance issues, try removing this fix mod before blaming Sodium.\n\nRelations\n-----\n\n### Forge\n\n**Requires** [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium): The issue does not exist without Rubidium. In that case, you won't need the mod.\n\n### Fabric\n\n**Requires** [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium): The issue does not exist without Sodium. In that case, you won't need the mod.\n\nEffect\n-----\n\n![](https://github.com/yezhiyi9670/occlusion-culling-fix-sodium/blob/master/logo-standard.png?raw=true)\n\nThe chunk with letters \"VISIBLE\" in it was hidden in vanilla because of [MC-70850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-70850). Mojang fixed that in 1.17, Sodium brought it back, and this mod fixed that again. You can get the test save for the bug on Mojira.\n\nSide Effects\n-----\n\nThough being an almost-proper fix, this fix does not completely match the intention of the original code. This might result in minor performance loss. However, we did not find significant performance drops.\n\nRelated Information\n-----\n\nThis fixes MC-70850 only. Another issue, [MC-63020](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-63020) causes a similar issue, and was fixed in 1.16.\n\nIncompatibilities\n-----\n\nNot found so far.\n\nPlans\n-----\n\nNew features will not be added to the mod in order to keep the name descriptive.

Based on the [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling) addon for Minecraft 1.12.2.\n\nThis addon adds a single new modifier for Tinkers' tools and armors - _Improvable_. Unlike original addon, tool levelling is not available from the start and must be applied to each piece of gear separately. After applying your tools are able to earn XP and level up. XP is earned by performing tool's intended actions like mining, harvesting, dealing damage, etc. On level up additional modifier slot and/or stat is rewarded.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Since Tinkers' Construct is based around limited amount of modifier slots and stats, this addon completely disrupts its balance!\n\nThis is an **unofficial** addon. Please do **not** reach out to the Tinkers' Construct developers for support and be sure to mention that this mod is installed if you do have an issue with Tinkers' Construct itself. You can report bugs and crashes related to Tinkers' Levelling Addon [here](https://github.com/Pyre540/tinkers-levelling-addon/issues).\n\n## Features\n\n- Earn tool XP by performing actions with your tools (mining, harvesting, shearing, attacking, etc.)\n- Earn armor XP by taking damage or using Thorns modifier\n- Gain 1 free modifier slot and/or stat per level up\n- Customize the order of modifier slot and/or stat types gained after each level up (or set it to random)\n- Set maximum level (or make it unlimited)\n- Adjust level requirements and experience sources\n- Customize level up sound and messages\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started simply apply _Improvable_ modifier to your tool/armor piece.

When using the mod, please use the Curse/CurseForge, Modrinth, or GitHub download and do not rehost the files.\n\nAny modpack which uses Tinkers' Construct takes full responsibility for user support queries.\n\nFor anyone else, we only support official builds from Curse/Curseforge, Modrinth, and GitHub. No custom built jars. We also do not take bug reports for outdated builds of Minecraft.\n\nThis project currently has builds for 1.18.2+ along with 1.6.4, 1.7.10, 1.12.2, and 1.16.5. If you are using a Minecraft version other than that which has a Tinkers release, make a request on our discord and I will upload the older build.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nTinkers' Construct is a mod about putting tools together in a wide variety of ways, then modifying them until they turn into something else. The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.\n\nThis mod includes many related features, including:\n* Part builders, tinker stations, and modifier workstations for building and modifying your tools\n* The melter, alloyer, smeltery, and foundry for working with molten metals\n* Slime islands generating as part of the overworld, nether, and end, granting access to 5 different slime colors\n* Slimy geodes spawning deep underground\n* Cobalt ore in the nether\n\nTo get started, craft Materials and You then follow the introduction steps. We will work on getting a better description here on Modrinth in the future - did not want to copy an outdated description from CurseForge.\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Tinkers' Construct 3\n\n* KnightMiner - Lead Developer\n* alexbegt - Developer\n* boni - former developer\n* mDiyo - Original author, game design input\n* RCXcrafter - Artist\n* See contributors on GitHub for a full list of contributors\n\n### Tinkers' Construct 2\n\n* boni - Lead Developer\n* KnightMiner - Developer\n* alexbegt - Developer/Updating\n* mDiyo - Original Author of the mod\n* Firedingo - General Task Support\n* Drullkus - Villager textures\n* Anbaric - Pattern chest and part chest model\n \n### Tinkers' Construct 1\n\n* mDiyo - Lead Developer\n* boni - Developer\n* fuj1n - Landmines, Former Developer\n* progwml6 - Former Developer\n* Fudgy_Fetus - Cutlasses\n* NekoGloop - Thaumium Textures\n* Skyboy - New tool renderer\n* Zerokyuuni - Battlegear support\n* Vexatos - Translations\n* BluSunrize - Casting Channels\n* tonius11 - NEI Support\n* baddaspig - Slime Crystal graphics","published":"2022-12-28T01:42:54.536335Z","updated":"2024-03-01T08:07:26.254767Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":166145,"followers":290,"categories":["equipment","magic","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.6.4","1.7.10","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["HXIzidIf","3KJI35bq","mNZUIBbe","qTJGiuCo","ADIRkxKS","jUnitpGk","3XnE2iWA","5x4nQV0E","TkJ6nDUK","rtqDbRrV","5s1u9uN2","4U8Td4Sc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rxIIYO6c/7a24bafaf8a7ce40cea07a4a070e6dd78a86ebd6.png"},"version":{"id":"4U8Td4Sc","project_id":"rxIIYO6c","author_id":"M8sIi0fq","featured":false,"name":"3.7.1.155","version_number":"3.7.1.155","changelog":"See the [3.7.0 changelog](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/releases/tag/3.7.0.152) for a more complete list of changes in the 3.7 update.

To edit/disable smooth zooming, edit the `lerp_amount` config option. To disable smooth zooming, set its value to `0`.\n\n### Smooth Camera on Zoom\nThe smooth/cinematic camera is enabled by default when zooming. To disable this, set `smooth_camera_on_zoom` to `false`.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use Just Zoom in modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n**To my patrons:**\n- OtakuGamer\n- Kreezxil\n- q!!!\n-

Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) -

Minecraft takes half an eternity to start - even though I have a solid pc setup.\nAn up-to-date computer takes <strong>7 minutes</strong>, a setup of 2015 approx. 15 min and a notebook of 2018 even needs more than 20 min to launch minecraft.\nThat's not really good.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4><span class=\"emoji-icon-wrap\">🔭</span><b> <strong>Roadmap</strong></b></h4>\n<p>At the moment Lightspeed decreases minecraft's launch time by approx. 48% - 62%. Every future update aims to improve it at least by 10%.<br />My final goal is that Lightspeed make your launch <strong>3 to 4 times faster</strong> than without using it. <br />Meaning an unoptimized launch of 7 minutes should <strong>be reduced to 2 minutes</strong>, 15 minutes to 4 minutes and so on. <br /><strong>If you like this mod,&nbsp;</strong>I would be happy if you post a comment with your inital launch time and the time achieved by using Lightspeed.</p>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\">🧭<strong>Maxims (Guiding principles)</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To ensure that my goal (improved loading times for everyone) is actually achieved, Lightspeed follows or should follow a few guiding principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Efficiency over multithreading</strong>:&nbsp;Not everyone has a gaming cpu with 12, 16 or even 20 cores. Therefore, Lightspeed relies on caches and other measures to minimize operations wherever possible.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Minimally invasive</strong>: Even though Lightspeed is changing existing source code, it's not an completely overhaul or rearrangement of it. Every adjustment&nbsp;takes place with utmost care.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(Ideally) no incompatiblilites</strong>: It's my goal that Lightspeed is and will be compatible with almost all mods out there - if you experience any crashes, weird behaviours or other issues please create an issue on GitHub.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Configurability</strong>: I'm aware that not all mods can be compatible with Lightspeed. But you can still use Lightspeed by disabling the problematic optimization feature in the config file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\"><strong>⚗️How it works</strong></h4>\n<p>Minecraft and Forge are using some ineffiecient or redundant ways to load, hold and process data. I found some of these.\nI implemented an alternative algorithm per inefficiency and then observed the startup again to verify that the change resulted in the expected improvement.\nLightspeed's optimizations will mainly focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reducing file system operations (especially read access)</li>\n<li>parallelizing suitable processes</li>\n<li>caching computed results and data</li>\n<li>improved data structures</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\"><strong>🖥️ Test-Setup&nbsp;</strong><strong>&amp; Compatibilties</strong></h4>\n<p>The following section contains all mods that I'm using in my modpack. Which means that all of these mods should be compatible with Lightspeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<details>\n<summary>Mod list</summary>\n<p>AbsentByDesign AdditionalAdditions AdditionalLanterns AdditionalLights Alcocraft Alexsmobs AmbientAdditions AmbientSounds Appetite AppleSkin AppollosAdditionalStructures Aquaculture Architects Architectury Artifacts AutoRegLib AwesomeDungeonEnd AwesomeDungeonNether AwesomeDungeonOcean Awesomedungeon BadMobs Balm Beautify Bettas BetterAdvancements BetterAnimalsPlus BetterBiomeBlend BetterFpsDist BetterModsButton BeyondEarth BiomesO'Plenty BlockCarpentry BlueSkies Bookshelf BotanyPots BottleYourXp BottledAir Breezy BuildersAddition BuildersDelight Camera Canary Chipped Chiseled Citadel ClothConfig CofhCore ColdsStructures Collective CombatRoll Configured ConnectedTexturesMod CookingForBlockheads CornDelight Create CreativeCore CreaturesAndBeasts CrittersAndCompanions Croptopia CulturalDelights Curios DecorationDelightMod DecorativeBlocks DeeperInTheCaves Delightful Diet DimDungeons DisplayCase DoggyTalents DomesticationInnovation DomumOrnamentum DrawerFps Duckies DungeonCrawl DungeonsArise DynamicSurroundings Ecologics EntityCollisionFpsFix EntityCulling ExlineFurniture ExoticBirds Expandability ExpandedCaves ExtendedLights FallingLeaves FantasyFurniture FarmersDelight FastLeafDecay FastWorkbench FeatureNbtDeadlockBeGone FerriteCore FinsAndTails FixMySpawnR Floralis Flowery FloweryCore Flywheel FoodEnhancements ForgottenBiomes FramedBlocks Furnish Geckolib Gemsnjewels GoProne Goodall GrapplingHookMod Gravestone GuardVillagers GuiClock HappyHolidays Hedgehog HopoBetterUnderwaterRuins Hyle ImmersiveEngineering ImmversiveFX InControl Incendium IndustrialForegoing InfinityButtons IntegratedStructuresAndDungeons Jade Jeed Jei JeiIntegration JourneyMap Kiwi KnightQuest Koremods KotlinForForge Krypton LazyDfu LibraryFerret LightMeals Lightspeed MacawsBridges MacawsBridgesBOP MacawsDoors MacawsFences MacawsFencesBOP MacawsFurniture MacawsLights MacawsPaths MacawsRoofs MacawsRoofsBOP MacawsTrapdoors MacawsWindows Mantle ManyIdeasCore ManyIdeasDoors Mapperbase McjtyLib MmLib ModernXl MonkeMadness MoogsVoyagerStructures MoreBeautifulPlates MoreStorageDrawers MoreVillagers MouseTweaks MrCrayfish'sFurniture Multibeds NamelessTrinkets Naturalist NaturesCompass Nekoration Nightlights NockEnoughArrows NotJustSandwich Notes Observable ObsidianBoat OhTheBiomesYou'llGo Optifine OutOfSight Pam'sHarvestcraftCrops Pam'sHarvestcraftFoodCore Pam'sHarvestcraftFoodExtended Pam'sHarvestcraftTrees Paraglider Patchouli Phireworks PickUpNotifier Placebo PlayerAnimator PresenceFootsteps PrettyBeaches PrimalReservation ProjectVibrantJourneys PuzzlesLib Pyrotastic Quark QuickPlant Reblured Rechiseled RecipesLibrary RefinedStorage Relics Reliquary RepurposedStructures RexsAdditionalStructures RfToolsBase RoughTweaks Searchlight SecretRooms SecurityCraft Selene ShetiphianCore Shrines Signpost SimpleDivingGear SimplyHouses SimplyLight Sit SmarterFarmers SmoothChunk SnowRealMagic SnowUnderTrees SnowySpirit SophisticatedBackpacks SophisticatedCore SophisticatedStorage SoundPhysics SpiceOfLife SpyglassImprovements Starlight StorageDrawers Structory StructureGel StylishEffects SuperMartijn642ConfigLib SuperMartijn642CoreLib Supplementaries SushiGoCrafting SushiMod TerraBlender Terralith TheAbyss2 TheVeggieWay ThermalCultivation ThermalExpansion ThermalFoundation ThermalInnovation ThermalIntegration ThermalLocomotion Titanium ToughAsNails TownsAndTowers Trapcraft UTeamCore UnionLib Unstructured UntamedWilds UnusualDrill UnusualEnd UsefulBackpacks VanillaDegus Villagernames Waddles Waystones WildBackport Wilds XercaMod Xnet XtraArrows YungsApi YungsBetterDesertTemples YungsBetterDungeons YungsBetterMineshafts YungsBetterStrongholds YungsBetterWitchHuts mOREs</p>\n</details>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 class=\"LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md\">❗<b><strong>Important Notes</strong></b></h4>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>The optimizations will only show an effect if you are using several or a lot of mods.</li>\n<li>Some future optimizations may directly tweak other mods. If you don't want that Lightspeed directly improve other mods behaviour you can still disable it - but launch times will be better with keeping them activated.</li>\n<li>It will probably not be possible to reduce the launch time down or near to vanilla level (about 40 seconds), because in spite of optimizations there is more to do than not using any mods - But I will try my best to retract that statement at some point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h5>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>📝<strong>FAQ</strong></b></h4>\n<details>\n<summary>Questions</summary>\n<p><strong><b>Q: Can I use Lightspeed in my modpack?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Yes -&nbsp; Feel free to include Lightspeed into your modpack - Remember to give credit and don't claim Lightspeed as your own creation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><b>Q: Which Minecraft versions are supported?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Lightspeed is currently available for </span><b>1.18.2. Other version will hopefully come soon - feel free to request a specific version.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there any known incompatibilities with other mods?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Not yet - most mods should be compatible with Lightspeed. If you are facing any problems when using Lightspeed please create an issue on GitHub.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><b>Q: I'm still facing high launch times. Why?</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: This mod is still work in progress - look at the Roadmap section for more info. Maybe some mods you are using contain inefficient algorithms. Feel free to create an issue on GitHub with your mod list. I will try to profile and to improve it. Another reason might be your&nbsp;maximum memory allocation (via -XMX) - if this value is too low, minecraft will try to free memory more often and this will hurt the launch time.</span></p>\n<details>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>🌎 <strong>Links</strong></b></h4>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/CCr4ft3r/lightspeed/issues\"><b>Report issues and request features</b></a></h5>","published":"2023-02-26T13:51:25.813576Z","updated":"2023-07-24T17:28:38.239271Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":79479,"followers":133,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["1qBK4kCo","SuV4Y2An","qUxcfIsc","Xmjn8tH7","8Sp2VL93","fZzwk293","loLGVTTD","4LtwayMk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/US93mifm/4654c35c06a33127e983896ebc046a7424b0b958.gif"},"version":{"id":"loLGVTTD","project_id":"US93mifm","author_id":"PiO0ZKEp","featured":false,"name":"lightspeed 1.18.2-1.1.0","version_number":"1.18.2-1.1.0","changelog":"-fixed incompatibilities with Ore Stone Variants and FullGrownCropMarker\n-fixed hang on at launch with for example \"I wanna Skate\" (thx to embeddedt for finding the cause)\n-fixed texture issue with Multiblocked","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-24T17:27:42.198542Z","downloads":15279,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"65bbf9d266d52bb31fa6cd1e46610ad1b80862243e56da1bd89f0c2e128df4f1ee61299bbc562a8460feeadedb94669aab483dcb9dab1464ff9893ffc39e032a","sha1":"172412a46c61659b6aa6a8df7b29a38fd721b5cf"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/US93mifm/versions/loLGVTTD/lightspeed-1.18.2-1.0.5.jar","filename":"lightspeed-1.18.2-1.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":50663,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"goIdp1Ik","user":{"id":"PiO0ZKEp","username":"CCr4ft3r","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118105353?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-26T13:49:54.011703Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lightspeed-1.18.2-1.0.5.jar"},"mods\\alexsmobs-1.18.6.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"1695fd872cbb0de06d3f19266fb1ac8910c5c787423e360e9c2ad5a468bb22e596740815ac81fa61dffb07716450d71afcf0b5279f2543a92fcd43dd7e61b732","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2cMuAZAp","slug":"alexs-mobs","project_type":"mod","team":"57mUV7xT","title":"Alex's Mobs","description":"85+ New mobs with stylistic quality above the default game.","body":"![Alex's Mobs](https://i.imgur.com/Se0dRBJ.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 89 new mobs to Minecraft.

All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

It makes use of modern 3D graphical APIs and technologies to provide real-time rendering with high performance. For good measure, Modern UI improves and optimizes a set of features used by Google Android and its own set of internationalization supporting text engine.\n\nModern UI for Minecraft, is a Minecraft Mod that is based on Modern UI Core Framework and Modern UI Core Extensions. It provides Modern UI bootstrap program in Minecraft environment and Modding API based on Forge/Fabric, to make powerful Graphical User Interface in Minecraft.\n\nFor client, press Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center screen to configure Modern UI. (Note that you can swipe the Preferences screen to configure fonts)\n\nThis Mod also includes a powerful text layout engine and text rendering system designed for Minecraft.\nThis engine provides appropriate methods for processing Unicode text and gives you more readable text in any scale, in 2D/3D. In details:\n* Real-time preview and reload TrueType/OpenType fonts\n* A better font fallback implementation\n* Anti-aliasing text and FreeType font hinting\n* Use improved SDF text rendering in 2D/3D (also use batch rendering)\n* Compute exact font size in device space for native glyph rendering\n* Use Google Noto Color Emoji and support all the Unicode 15.1 Emoji (September 12, 2023)\n* Configurable bidirectional text heuristic algorithm\n* Configurable text shadow and raw font size\n* Unicode line breaking and CSS line-break & word-break\n* Fast, exact and asynchronous Unicode text layout computation\n* Faster and more memory efficient rectangle packing algorithm for glyphs\n* Use real grayscale texture (1 byte-per-pixel, whereas Minecraft is 4 bpp)\n* Compatible with OptiFine, Sodium (Rubidium), Iris (Oculus) and many mods\n* Compatible with Minecraft's JSON font definition (bitmap fonts, TTF fonts)\n\nAdditionally, this Mod provides many utilities which improve game performance and gaming experience. Currently, we have:\n* Changing screen background color\n* Gaussian blur to screen backdrop image\n* Fade-in animation to screen background\n* More window modes: Fullscreen (borderless), Maximized (borderless)\n* Framerate limit and master volume fading on window inactive (out of focus) and minimized\n* Pausing single-player game when Inventory is open\n* Changing GUI scale option to Slider and providing hint text\n* Playing a \"Ding\" sound when Minecraft loads and reaches the Main Menu\n* Enabling smooth scrolling in Vanilla's Selection List and Forge's Scroll Panel\n* Pressing \"C\" to Zoom that is the same as OptiFine\n* Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) and Unicode grapheme/word iterator for all text fields\n* Playing local music, allowing to seek and view spectrum\n* Support Discord/Slack/GitHub/IamCal/JoyPixels emoji shortcodes in Chatting\n* A fancy tooltip style\n  + Choose rounded border or normal border (with shadow effect)\n  + Add title break and control title line spacing\n  + Auto line wrapping and auto vertical scrolling when out of screen\n  + Center the title line, support RTL layout direction\n  + Exactly position the tooltip to pixel grid (smooth movement)\n  + Change background color and border color (with gradient and animation)\n \n\n### Core Features:\n\n* 2D Graphics Library of Multiple Graphics APIs\n* Intermediate Representation and ASTs of Shading Languages\n* Symbolic distance function and vector graphics rendering\n* Image post-processing effects\n* Fast matrix and vector calculation\n* Image format conversion\n* Animation and transition framework\n* Event loop and multi-threading framework\n* Text shaping and complex text layout engine\n* MVVM and lifecycle handling\n* Automatic RTL (right-to-left) UI layout\n* Markdown (CommonMark) rendering support\n \n\n### Modern Text Engine for Minecraft:\n\n* Support color Emoji, use Google Noto Color Emoji 15.1, based on Unicode 15.1 Emoji list;\n* Support Emoji shortcodes in chat, for example :rofl: to rolling on the floor laughing, support Discord and Slack shortcodes;\n* You can use TTF or OTF fonts, configure the font base size, set the baseline shift, and set whether to drop text shadow;\n* Scalable vector graphics, automatic switching resolution level (up to 96px), native (non-synthetic) Bold and Italic rendering;\n* Supports distance field text rendering in 3D world, but sharpens font atlas in 2D GUI; This enhances a former feature:\n  *Render all characters smoothly on any scale (like when you're away from a sign, or a very small text in GUI)\n* Support multilayer text, layout multiple paragraphs together, streaming layout algorithm, and introduce fast layout cache;\n* Support fast digit replacement, high-precision layout and alignment, and smoothly draw fast changing digits (fixed width);\n* Support mip-mapping, anti-aliasing, linear sampling and supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA);\n* Better and more efficient layout of BiDi text paragraphs (e.g. Arabic, Yiddish); Use sharpen font atlases;\n* Configurable BiDi text heuristic algorithm to control text direction more accurately; Support to fix invalid surrogate pairs;\n* Use HarfBuzz text shaping, support combining characters rendering, like Thai, Devanagari, Bengali and Tamil;\n* Support grapheme cluster break, support Unicode line breaking algorithm;\n* Support context-aware and locale-based word break and line break;\n* Support pixelated font rendering, support fixed resolution level, support pixel alignment;\n* Support bitmap replacement, rendering smoothly for fast changing numbers, support emoji rendering;\n* Optimize the layout algorithm, increase your FPS by about 10% when drawing texts in GUI\n* Use grayscale pixels to store texture, reduce GPU memory usage\n* Reduce unnecessary RAM usage and greatly reduce object creation\n\n### Customize Fonts\nPress Ctrl+K or ⌘+K (by default) to open Action Center, go to Preferences, swipe the screen to the second page, and you will see Font settings.\n* Preferred font family is your most wanted one. It can be either an OS font or a TrueType/OpenType font (collection) file.\n* Fallback font families are used when the preferred font family is unavailable.\n\nModern Text Engine:  \nModern UI follows Minecraft's JSON font definition, only glyph provider type 'legacy_unicode' and 'unihex' are ignored. Modern UI font families mentioned above will serve as fallback font families for Minecraft fonts. Default Font Behavior (in Preferences > Text Layout) gives you an option to remove some glyph providers from the Minecraft default font (minecraft:default). To avoid using vanilla ASCII fonts, just set it to Keep Other. Note this option is only valid if you have not turned on Force Unicode Font. If you want to use vanilla Unicode font, just download the OTF version of [GNU Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/).\n\n### Additional Features for Minecraft:\n\n* Support setting window mode, such as fullscreen borderless, windowed borderless;\n* GUI screen background fade-in animation and 2-pass gaussian convolution blur effect, configurable background gradient color;\n* Smooth rounded tooltip style, support RTL layout, configurable background and border color;\n* Play a \"ding\" sound effect when the game is loaded;\n* Support pausing the game when your inventory is opened;\n* New GUI scale algorithm and slider GUI scale widget (not limited to even numbers, compatible with OptiFine);\n* Add smooth scrolling for vanilla and forge scrolling panels;\n* Async network handler; Server auto-shutdown;\n* All features are configurable in configs or Action Center screen (default shortkey Ctrl+K)\n\n### Modern UI for Fabric removed some features (compared to the Forge version):\n* OptiFine-like zoom, hide crosshairs in GUI\n* Dump more debugging information, crash report extension\n \n### Comparison with Caxton text rendering techniques\n[Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton) mod is known for its MSDF text rendering, you can choose between Caxton and Modern Text Engine.   \n\nSimilarities:\n* Both use HarfBuzz text shaping\n* Both support Unicode text processing\n* Both support Unicode line breaking and grapheme cluster break\n* Both compatible with Iris in raster rendering mode\n* Both have an efficient rectangle packing algorithm, further better than Mojang's\n\nDifferences:\n* Caxton uses a newer HarfBuzz whereas we use a older one (bundled with JDK 17, it's updated in JDK 21)\n* Caxton uses multi-channel SDF and renders sharper scaling-up texts, whereas we render over-rounded\n* We are compatible with OptiFine, whereas Caxton isn't\n* We support color emoji, whereas Caxton doesn't\n* We support FreeType font hinting whereas Caxton never support it, font hinting helps on low-res monitor\n* We support perfect sampling of native glyph image in screen-space, this is ideal for 2D rendering\n* We support single-channel SDF text rendering without additional GPU resources, we always use 1bpp textures\n* We have smart SDF sampling method for scaling-down texts, whereas Caxton hasn't\n* No need to wait for MSDF texture generation, you can switch fonts in-game with just one click\n* We support various text direction heuristics and line break strategies\n* We don't use additional native libraries, so Modern UI works on macOS\n* We have a slightly higher layout performance than Caxton, and use less RAM\n\n### Mod Integration & Compatibility:\n\n#### Compatible (you should pay attention to):\n\nOptiFine, Sodium, Iris, Create, AoA3  \nIf Shaders are active, *Use Modern Text Shaders in 3D* is auto disabled, it will cause the outline of glowing text to become invisible.\n\n#### Mods with similar functions are replaced:\n\n* Blur (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: full functional coverage, better optimization)\n  + Blur mod claims to use Gaussian blur, but I found it actually uses 2-pass box blur. Whereas Modern UI gives you the true 1-pass Gaussian Blur, which is better than Blur mod.\n* Controlling (ver 1.15; reason: another way of implementation)\n* TipTheScales (ver 1.15 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Inventory Pause (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Emojiful (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: we support color emoji rendering since 3.5.0)\n* Borderless Window (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* Ding (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; reason: another way of implementation)\n* FPS Reducer (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; reason: another way of implementation)\n\n\n#### Conflict and Solution:\n\n* Emojiful (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* Legendary Tooltips (ver 1.16 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI tooltip, via config screen)\n* FeyTweaks (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable TextRendererMixin in FeyTweaks' mixin config)\n* SmoothScrollingEverywhere (ver 1.18 ~ 1.19; solution: disable Modern UI smooth scrolling, via config screen)\n* Caxton (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text engine, via config screen or bootstrap properties)\n* ImmediatelyFast (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable ImmediatelyFast's hud_batching, font_atlas_resizing and fast_text_lookup)\n* Sodium (ver 1.20; Sodium is known to be incompatible with Rounded Tooltip, disable Tooltip -> Border Style -> Rounded Corners)\n* Untranslated Items (ver 1.18 ~ 1.20; solution: disable Modern UI text component cache, via config screen)\n\n#### Supported MC versions:\n* Actively maintained: 1.20.4, 1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2\n* About to be dropped: 1.20.2, 1.20, 1.18.2, 1.18.1\n* No longer supported: 1.18, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.16.4, 1.16.3, 1.16.2, 1.16.1, 1.15.2, 1.14.4\n\nAll descriptions on this page are for Minecraft 1.19.4 and above. Some features may be missing in older versions.\n\n#### PC Requirements (same as Minecraft Vanilla)\nSome people are unwilling to use Modern UI because they believe that Modern UI has a high PC requirements. In fact, as long as you can play Minecraft Vanilla, you can definitely play Modern UI. Unless you forget to update your GPU driver.\n* OS: Windows 8.1+, Linux with X11 or Wayland, macOS\n* Architecture: x64 or arm64\n* GPU: GeForce 210 or better\n* GPU Driver: OpenGL 3.3+ or Vulkan 1.1+, higher is better\n* Java: Java 17+, higher is better\n\n\n### FAQ:\n\n##### Q: What is the difference between Default Font Behavior and Force Unicode Font?\nA: Firstly, Modern UI always redirects Unicode font to Modern UI default typeface. Default Font Behavior is KEEP ALL in 1.19+, then Minecraft default font is used for ASCII characters. KEEP OTHER means that Minecraft default font is no longer used, but additional fonts, for example, in some minigame maps, are still available. This is the difference from Force Unicode Font (IGNORE ALL).\n\n##### Q: Does Modern UI have a high overhead? Will Modern UI lower application performance?\nA: No, Modern UI does not have a significant impact on CPU, GPU, RAM, and VRAM usage. This is because Modern UI itself has good optimization, but at the same time, Modern UI provides a bunch of new features and effects. Modern UI framework is known to be more efficient than Chromium-based applications.\nFor low-end PCs, screen blur effect may be a performance killer, because Minecraft Vanilla does not allow mipmap generation on render targets. Even so, the blur effect provided by Modern UI is much faster than a mod called 'Blur'.\n\n##### Q: How to disable all changes to vanilla, I don't want these features.\nA: Only GUI scale algorithm and some low-level code are non-configurable, any other features can be disabled in Action Center screen (shortkey Ctrl+K by default), or config files (gameDir/config/ModernUI/), because Modern UI is essentially a framework.\n\n##### Q: Is this mod a client-only mod? Do I need to install it on the server?\nA: Since MC 1.19.2, there is no reason to install this mod on the server anymore. All server features are deprecated and implemented to Forge API and Fabric API.\n\n##### Q: How to get start to develop my mod based on Modern UI?\nA: This project is still in early stages, the specification is still being written. You can view the [JavaDoc](https://blocamlimb.github.io/ModernUI/javadoc/). Examples include Modern UI itself (Action Center) and Flux Networks.

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-03-21T18:51:34.985470Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":352196,"followers":480,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qBbqV301","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":false,"name":"11.7.6

It changes color dependent on its Redstone input, what makes it easy to display 16 states in a single Block. You can also right-click the Rainbow Lamp (while not sneaking) to cycle through all colors, if it isn't powered. Like the Vanilla Redstone Lamp, it also emits light unless it is in its black state.\n\nEspecially the right-click feature can certainly be used for decoration, but the Rainbow Lamp might also be interesting for Redstoners - think of a start signal for a racetrack or a working color display ...\n\n<img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/482/941/showcase.png\"/>\n\n<p></p>\n\nThe recipe for the Rainbow Lamp:\n\n<img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/482/942/recipe.png\"/>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nIf you want your own Minecraft server to play with friends, check out Kinetic Hosting.

All chests with the same color buttons share an inventory. Ender bags can be color coded to access chests as well giving you a portable solution to the question \"How do I access the stuff at my base when I am not there?\"\n \n\nEnderStorage is a mod that offers a means to store your items in The END, causing them to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. All EnderStorage makes use of the magic of colors to link storage with its little piece of The END. Any EnderStorage with the same color code share inventory (even across dimensions). Currently there are three types of storage, EnderChest, EnderPouch and EnderTank.\n\nEnderChests are a stationary type of EnderStorage. You can use dye on the wool pads on top of the chest to alter its color code. As an alternative, you can craft an EnderChest with three dyes to change the color code as well. EnderChests work as any other chest for the purposes of blocks that manipulate chests contents. This makes EnderChests an ideal way to transport items over vast distances in an instant.\n\nEnderPouches are a mobile type of EnderStorage. You can use an EnderPouch on any EnderChest to change the pouch color code to match that of the chest. EnderPouches access the same inventory as their EnderChest counterparts, allowing easy access to your base resources right from your inventory.\n \n\nEnderTanks work on the same principal of EnderChests but store liquids.\n\nUsing a diamond on the latch of an Ender Chest will move it to a seperate network for the player that used the diamond. This allows each player to have acceess to all 4096 frequencies without conflicting in SMP\n\n\nWe are partnered with [CreeperHost](https://www.creeperhost.net/partner/covers1624vpp)!

You need to create a datapack following the same pattern as the embedded values in `data/modid/fallingleaves/blockname.json` with the following syntax and default values:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"spawnrate\": 1.0,\n  \"isConifer\": false\n}\n```","published":"2022-06-27T10:27:42.813469Z","updated":"2024-02-23T13:58:04.190008Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":155073,"followers":108,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["JgAIxUhy","3iNcBn5v","a8aXDowL","OMz3I51w","LGxPH3kT","YYzqLaCF","T0Vuacdc","LtSDNmU4","vvmKGwgK","oyILpkgl","7DSFuLx6","TzedjL2r","lWVMkenc","eTqAeXTY","qCMwYRMZ","BxnTW71f","sf6rQV1I","mT2MWO6E","jTJdbzqz","EYKnoDe8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2JAUNCL4/icon.gif"},"version":{"id":"a8aXDowL","project_id":"2JAUNCL4","author_id":"54VXTJtr","featured":false,"name":"Fallingleaves-1.18.2-1.3.2","version_number":"1.18.2-1.3.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-27T10:27:42.837918Z","downloads":5824,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d8df653ace333ba1543631ca182096c32f5b8eb6","sha512":"5b550dfac95f8af8dec26d84960b58804eba241554872ab4ec0826f43a444aec1fc7d01e9bae43c289632cf4defb6dac7cbc7f8ff456abdc0a5fdecad7f27a8e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2JAUNCL4/versions/1.18.2-1.3.2/Fallingleaves-1.18.2-1.3.2.jar","filename":"Fallingleaves-1.18.2-1.3.2.jar","primary":true,"size":119909,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"zNArgcOq","user":{"id":"54VXTJtr","username":"cheaterpaul","name":"Paul Becker","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17816456?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-09T17:33:41.941747Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fallingleaves-1.18.2-1.3.2.jar"},"mods\\cc-tweaked-1.18.2-1.101.3.jar":{"sha512":"dff864e824f111b5901414b633e13ca2ff3685195f1d2992bdf6a3470fb6e1119ba7e995d99575296415fccb00c6cb99939e6a47fdc7983b322f3f65e805a27f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gu7yAYhd","slug":"cc-tweaked","project_type":"mod","team":"xob83kJz","title":"CC: Tweaked","description":"ComputerCraft fork adding programmable computers, turtles and more to Minecraft.","body":"<!--\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022 The CC: Tweaked Developers\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0\n-->\n\n# ![CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/logo.png)\nCC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-03-03T15:49:49.763780Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2164993,"followers":3197,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"tQFy1FeZ","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

Adds Thermal-style tools and equipment!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Innovation\" - a collection of things which increase player-centric power - useful tools, gadgets, and armor.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

Please add the correct version to your mod folder.\n\nTo use the in-game manual you need the mod Patchouli in your pack.\n\n\n## THE EXTREME REACTOR API\n\nThe API jar is available on my maven rep: https://maven.zerono.it/\n\n\n## NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE 1.12.2\n\n\n**Turbine Coils update! (versions 2.0.38 and following)**\n\nThere are now three new (one is making its comeback) late/end game coils for extracting a huge amount of power from your Turbines: Ludicrite, Ridiculite and Inanite. You should expect around 45K / 75K / 115K FE/t from a full coil in a Reinforced Turbine from each of them.\n\nMod(-pack) authors can now use the /er coils command to fine tune any new coil they add to ER\n\n\n**The Fluid Fuels update!  (version 1.16.5-2.0.32 / 1.17.1-2.0.32 and following)**\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels (and wastes) reactants in fluid form that you can insert in your Reactors without any material loss using the new Fuel Injection Port set in inlet mode. Fluid wastes will be ejected into an Injection Port set in outlet mode.\n\nHow will you make fluid fuels? With a new multiblock machine: the Fluidizer!\n\nYou will need a Controller, a Power Port, an Output Port and the usual mix of Casing and Glass parts (if you like the Glass, right now the fluid is not rendered inside the multiblock). There are two kind of Injector Ports that will let you insert material in the Fluidizer:\n\n- the Fluidizer Solid Injector for solid ingots or blocks\n- the Fluidizer Fluid Injector for liquid fuels\n\nOne Solid Injector will let you convert your solid fuel to it's fluid form\n\nTwo Solid Injectors will let to convert and mix two different solid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nTwo Fluid Injectors will let you convert and mix two different fluid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nMixing fuels with usually give you a better fuel than the original ones\n\nPlease check in JEI for the recipes (more recipes can be added using Vanilla recipe system)\n\n- All fuels and wastes in fluid form can be placed in the world. It will be probably not a good idea to swim in them\n\n- Added the Verderium fuel. The top tier fuel\n\n- Added the Rossinite waste. It will make you go fast like the GOAT\n\n- Added /er command (op level 2+). Useful for pack authors to fine tune fuel values\n\n\n**The Fuel Update (version 1.16.5-2.0.29 / 1.17.1-2.0.29 and following)\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels reactants that produce fuels with different properties from each other. This allow ER and mods / modpacks to add different kind of fuels using the ER API (FuelProperties / ReactantsRegistry) or the API modpack-wrapper. If no fuel properties are specified for new fuels reactants, the default ones (Yellorium) are used. This will allow the creations of other fuels by mixing existing ones, once liquid fuels are finalized.\n\nBlutonium is back as a full-fledged reactant and fuel, with a better yield than Yellorium (keep in mind that it's properties are not set in stone right now), and it's \"crafted\" by reprocessing Cyanite.\n\nBlutonium will turn into Magentite, a new waste-type reactant, after being used in the Reactor. There is currently no use for it in the mod, but who knows what will happen in the future.\n\n\n**The Reprocessor (version 1.16.5-2.0.29 and following)\n\nA new multiblock machine that's able to reprocess wastes into new fuels. You will use it, for example, to craft Blutonium from Cyanite (check the recipe in JEI).\n\nThe Reprocessor is a 3x3x7 (x/z/y, external dimiensions) multiblock build using Reprocessor Casing blocks for the frame or faces. Reprocessor Glass blocks can be used instead of Casing on the faces. You need one (and only one) of each of the other Reprocessor parts (Controller, Collector, Waste Injector, Fluid Injector, Output Port, Power Port). The Waste Inject goes in the top face, the Collector on the bottom face. The other ones can go on any vertical face.\n\nThe Reprocessor recipes use an item and a fluid to craft another item. Mods and modpacks authors can add they own recipes in the usal ways. The Reprocessor need 1000 FE to process a single recipe. You can check the available recipes in JEI.\n\n\n**1.16.x / 1.17.x\n\n- In-game documentation is available with the The Extreme Book! (you need Patchouli too)\n\n- The Reactor and Turbine comes in two initial variants: Basic and Reinforced\n\nThe Basic variant is your early game choice: cheap and small (5x5x5 max for the Reactor, 5x5x10 for the Turbine)\n\nThe Reinforced variant if your heavy duty one: machines as big as you want (check your server config file) and build from steel ingots (or a botload of iron if your pack lack steel)\n\n- The internal buffers (energy / fluids) size of any Reactors and Turbines is a function of the machine size.\n\n- There are now two general tipes of Power Taps and Fluid Ports: active and passive\n\n - an Active one will send out power or fluids (or retrive them) automatically to the block connected to it\n\n - a Passive one will send out power or fluids (or accept them) ony if the block connected to it request it\n\n - using both types allow you to fine tune your energy or fluids distribution network\n\n- The Access Port has gone Solid ... the old girl is not as good as it was in the past at converting fuel ingots to liquid fuel. But it's still does a good jot at it\n\n- The Fuel Rod rendesing is even more FPS friendlier than before. You should have not rendering performance problems even with a huge number of Fuel Rods in your Reactors\n\n- Reactor / Turbine Forge Energy Charging Port. Use it to charge items that use energy (FE) to operate. Open the GUI and put the item in the input slot in the center (more info in the book).\n\n- Turbine Rotor can be build with any combinatios of blades you want (provided that their variant match the Turbine's and, well, it is a valid rotor :)) and will be animated using the shape you build\n\n- New fancy and FPS friendly GUI because i like fancy stuff and you like your FPSs\n\n- The Reinforced Computer Port support CC-Tweaked LUA program to help you manage your Reactors and Turbines\n\n- Modpack authors can use the Creative Water Generator / Steam Generator to create self sustaining Turbines setups or as a rare loot for their players\n\n- Ore-regen: the mod can re-generate it's ores by setting the \"enableWorldRegeneration\" config option to true. \n\nWorldgen must be enabled too, and so does the specific ore options you want to re-generate. If you need to re-generate chunks again, increate the value of the config option \"userWorldGenVersion\"\n\n\n## ABOUT A JEI PLUGIN\n\nAs you may have noticed, ER do not come with a JEI plugin that list all the moderators, fuels, coils, etc and their properties. The reason is simple: I don't want to have one. It would be no fun having the answer to \"what's work best\" outside the game, instead have fun and experiment!\n\nSince there are tons of blocks and items in any modern pack, in 2.0.6 I've added a tooltip to items and blocks that could be used as fuel or moderators for the Reactors or Turbine coils. It's an advanced tooltip so you need to enable them to spoil your fun :) There is also a client config option to disable them if needed\n\nI'm planning to have an in-game method to test your Reactor designs without having to build a whole one. The key code is already in place and Reactors and Turbines can already run in simulation mod\n\nAlso, to my fellow modders: please DO NOT add an external JEI plugin that show fuels, moderators, etc, for my mod, thank you.\n\n\n## MODPACKS AND LET'S PLAYs AND OTHER PERMISSIONS\n\nYou can add Extreme Reactors 2 (and Zero Core 2) to your mod pack or use them in your let's play / live streams to your heart content, no need to ask for my permission: you got it.\n\nIf you like, post a comment here or on the main forum thread to let's us know what fun stuff you are doing with the mods so we can all share in the fun. \n \nNo one is authorized to repost my mods, or any part of them, on any other website other then Curse Forge. If you wish, you can link to this page (or the Zero Core 2 one) from your website to let your users download the mod.\n\n\n## A NOTE ON SAFETY\n\nWe release our mods only on CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher and their respective websites:\n\nIf you found our mods on another website be sure that they do not come from us and we cannot guarantee that you are downloading something safe to use and that will work on your version of Minecraft. To keep things short: do not download those files and always use the CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher or their respective websites\n\n","published":"2022-11-18T17:48:49.314155Z","updated":"2023-10-15T15:17:27.715781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":58997,"followers":46,"categories":["technology","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["HnaPALbm","29cP26iq","q6eZgnW3","lXY8AQnu","qb93c55m","O76WSn3r","yk4Vc39G","2WVMMW6H","NfRN5BFW","xHyu5PeP","YAUrhKii","X49ifA8H","q1zYEzRt","NB4zEHJK","WYlgL8NK","qSp5oA64","xWhrtnGG","GEXjCRxl","rnzB7p2Y","lpEA1SCq","H8hwL9KY","OFI6WnhE","WjWzQcbH","tQHXTlmS","162lYZcb","JZOQJiht","ZaHjUOrO","1L7HJQWM","aWj4vg3e","lzg72TTO","xwLWlGec","lu5PWrmf","5CYl80HP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/48547286b3acecb37d1fe7e2befaa631c65f29af.png"},"version":{"id":"1L7HJQWM","project_id":"idkvShUy","author_id":"aPljNITF","featured":true,"name":"1.18.2-2.0.71","version_number":"1.18.2-2.0.71","changelog":"- Added new end-game Turbine coil : Insanite\n- Rebalanced eng-game Turbine coils\n- Bumped version to 2.0.71","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-25T18:32:08.715403Z","downloads":1025,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f23a8a13d5097b41d9a959f54d66adefe214de01","sha512":"9a1f604f691aa1b03d6198b6243bc6354fd003158cb75e76a52af959fe986937488efe324b4b21f4b50ccc75373c6a2c2da935ee010425fa44ee2f4101a8a15d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/versions/1L7HJQWM/ExtremeReactors2-1.18.2-2.0.71.jar","filename":"ExtremeReactors2-1.18.2-2.0.71.jar","primary":true,"size":2328319,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"kLwY6kGT","project_id":"rHpb85Mf","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gp0ELhxH","user":{"id":"aPljNITF","username":"ZeroNoRyouki","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7107662?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-18T16:37:13.031737Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ExtremeReactors2-1.18.2-2.0.71.jar"},"mods\\CodeChickenLib-1.18.2-4.1.4.488-universal.jar":{"sha512":"317eefa7c5dcdd10bf5d03647ba3756e17aa5a18e5eb163c14a2b07b75bad96387f3186629d4d278a320ec3c7be11abea125145b0c604041bd2d3e4bebeb0bc1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2gq0ALnz","slug":"codechicken-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"uKLuorQT","title":"CodeChicken Lib","description":"Contains various libraries for 3D math and transformations, rendering, networking, configs, and much, much more.","body":"Library mod for Chicken-Bones mods.\n\nContains various libraries for 3D math and transformations, rendering, networking, configs, and much, much more.\n\nPlease see our GitHub repository for maven/dependency information if you wish to use this yourself.\n\nWe are partnered with [CreeperHost](https://www.creeperhost.net/partner/covers1624vpp)!

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options (1.18.2 only).\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

With this mod they can be animated to either appear from below, above, or their horizontal direction relative to the player. \n\n## Performance\nThis mod should not impact FPS considerably because all it does is render chunks \"somewhere else\".\n\n## Usage\nBy default, chunks will animate from below using a Sine easing function. This can be changed to a number of different configurations using the config, which can be found in `config/chunkanimator-client.toml` relative to the Minecraft directory. For more information on these options, see [the Wiki page](https://github.com/Harleyoc1/ChunkAnimator/wiki/Config).\n\n## OptiFine\nOptiFine is supported, however for the chunks to be animated you will need to make sure the `render regions` option is disabled (set to `false`). This can be found under the `Performance` screen in `Video Settings`, or as `ofRenderRegions` in the `optionsof.txt` file relative to the Minecraft directory.\n\n## Licensing\nPermission is hereby granted to use this mod in ANY mod pack or server.

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Integration\" - all of the compatibility materials, recipes, and enhancements to make the Thermal Series play even better alongside some common - and not so common - mods. The goal is to blend both style and functionality without compromising or unbalancing the larger modded ecosystem, so config options are in place to quickly disable entire feature sets.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16]https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2024-02-27T16:59:06.255308Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1220536,"followers":624,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr","N4NxIVYC","jPAtAJcJ","RYxPLFUw","NMOJStju","qIAY6mKt","JUrMdJP1","VIE9sG8O","f6LbzxNL","TGc6wvHK","lt2lEcIY","1hau5QwF","VH4LTqFp","H0a9rBTV","6ryA9MPE","Q0xpW61Y","hDWb6gW2","7rTXTEe7","uZyJkfxk","SLbLamWu","ZuihLitZ","C95JH5YK","zXq0pj5R","VhfHxcat","2OHf9GyZ","QiuQRA7s","kjIgNYGA","tC2vMFuQ","AUJXa9xo","v1tAteat","fzqus8s0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"RAATKbAN","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"3.2.6+forge-1.18.2","version_number":"3.2.6+forge-1.18.2","changelog":"- Fixed UseBlock and UseItem events on Fabric not respecting cancellation, causing an issue in Hardcore Revival\n- Fixed loot table modifiers preventing other mods from modifying loot tables dynamically","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-17T18:00:16.979969Z","downloads":22401,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9a55d477452cebb10eaf3e9c4cd711b0fc6b361e60513c2475992e279189de68b9a660d69d047a0d80d21469ecb01d7b4fe85b494b396a23ea19db72f2eb8d13","sha1":"e503e90e41279afddec03d196073f7f7eabd0735"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/RAATKbAN/balm-3.2.6.jar","filename":"balm-3.2.6.jar","primary":true,"size":622514,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-3.2.6.jar"},"mods\\TCIntegrations-1.18.2-2.0.18.1.jar":{"sha512":"bfaa55e76f939eb2cb8f649f269108cc9dd224ba0635e5308c92c4582a9d302eacaf101cbf0ddcfbfcc0d2b655cd57c916f02d16b56c0cd30b282cbd2f8e4fe0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jNa5P8yc","slug":"tcintegrations","project_type":"mod","team":"LwlILHOg","title":"Tinkers' Integrations and Tweaks","description":"A collection of mod integrations and tweaks for Tinkers' Construct.","body":"The main goal here is to not just add a bunch of random new materials from mods and call it \"integration\". The goal is to add materials where it makes sense, and capture the capabilities of other mods tools and armors in Tinkers' Construct.

This entire concept has worked out well, and the idea moving forward is balanced integration.\n\nAlmost everything in the mod is datapack driven and can be overridden via datapack. Some of the mod integration abilities are hard coded to match the mod capability for the integration, which is intentional.\n\n**Will take requests for other tweaks and integrations!**\n\n## Mod Integrations\n### 🔵 Botania\n * Adds Manasteel to smeltery\n * Manasteel parts add \"Mana\" modifier\n   * \"**Mana**\" modifer allows tools to repair with any mana generating inventory item (60 mana cost)\n * Adds Livingwood as tool part material\n   * \"**Livingwood**\" modifier reduces material repair costs by 75%\n * Adds Livingstone as tool part material\n   * Better stats than rock\n * Adds \"**Terra**\" upgrade modifier for primary weapons\n   * Repairs weapon if any mana generating inventory item is present (100 mana cost)\n   * When swung and the attack recharge meter is full, it will use 100 Mana and create a damaging Mana burst that deals 7 points (3.5 hearts) of damage to the hit mob\n * Adds \"**Elemental**\" upgrade modifier for primary weapons\n   * Repairs weapon if any mana generating inventory item is present (70 mana cost)\n   * 5% chance to spawn a Pixie on hit\n   * Beheading chance if a Zombie, Skeleton, Wither Skeleton, Creeper, the Guardian of Gaia, should be implemented with similar chance to the Elementium Axe\n * Adds \"**Terrestrial**\" upgrade modifier for armor as a complete \"set\" bonus\n   * Passive generation of 1 Mana every 10 ticks on Mana Tablets\n   * 20% decrease of Mana cost on all Mana-using TCon items (Can't translate to Botania items)\n   * Passive regeneration of 2 health every 4 seconds if their hunger bar isn't full\n * Adds \"**Great Fairy**\" upgrade modifier for armor as a complete \"set\" bonus\n   * 10% decrease of the Mana cost on all Mana-using TCon items (Can't translate to Botania items)\n   * If the player is attacked while wearing this armor piece, there's an % chance (depends on armor piece, same as Botania) to spawn a Pixie after being attacked.\n   * Pixies spawned by the wearer will inflict a random potion effect for 2 seconds: either Blindness, Wither, Slowness or Weakness.\n### 🟠 MythicBotany\n * Adds \"**Alf**\" upgrade modifier for primary weapons\n   * Requires \"**Terra**\" upgrade modifier to upgrade\n   * Adds additional repair if any mana generating inventory item is present (100 mana cost)\n   * Acts as an item magnet when using interact (normal interact when holding shift)\n * Adds \"**Alfheim**\" upgrade modifier for armor\n   * Requires \"**Terrestrial**\" modifier to upgrade\n   * Set bonus increases armor repair rate\n   * Helmet increases reach distance\n   * Chestplate adds knockback resistance\n   * Leggings increase run/swim speed\n   * Boots increase jump height when sprinting\n### 🟡 Create\n * Adds tool material for Brass\n   * Material has similar stats to Bronze\n   * Adds \"**Moderate**\" modifier that makes the tool mine faster in moderate temperatures\n * Adds \"**Engineer's Goggles**\" ability\n   * Can upgrade helmet with Engineer's Goggles, adding same functionality\n * Adds \"**Mechanical Arm**\" ability \n   * Adds ability to attack with any melee weapon in the offhand\n### 🟢 Aquaculture 2\n * Adds Neptunium to smeltery\n * Neptunium parts add \"**Water Powered**\" modifier\n   * Tools resist damage while in water\n * Adds \"**Poseidon**\" modifier for armor\n   * Helmet -

It's because of the 8:1 block ratio between the Nether and the Overworld. It's really weird though that you enter a portal in the overworld, and then when going back through where you came, come out of a different portal in the overworld. This mod fixes that issue.\n\nIt keeps track of what portals a player went through in order to ensure correct destinations when the player is going back through the same portals. The 1:8 ratio remains, portals just get smarter and remember where you came from.\n\n## Features\n\n- As long as players use the same portal to return to the overworld, they will end up where they came from\n- Only needs to be installed on the server (but works in singleplayer as well)\n\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_broken.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /> \n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_fixed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" />\n</p>","published":"2022-06-14T21:48:05.255247Z","updated":"2023-12-28T20:58:02.479017Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":591958,"followers":292,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["W2GQFVWF","KchVyZcY","lvjIpOkl","8Z8NExgb","ermlUjF9","Xgt8gsvh","3ABQuZux","mZoHwPFg","jlARFVYj","609MPxvC","fAtDIamf","kpXZdI4d","b11QoY35","Aa31SP8V","wX5DuGY9","FNyz19JT","nGNVabdg","HXKeuKnk","5UbTkcSQ","aeJtHUBZ","NANcEzKA","cWPAnu7u","5mUp7FiY","WJBCsJlq","CUncGC4R","sdRhw16z","QNaqDHXQ","Xma4SDMw","VU2uPLbX","DDMLN9aT","VtIpicaF","QWBZRKVi","6tDPIRKi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nPZr02ET/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"b11QoY35","project_id":"nPZr02ET","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"9.0.1+forge-1.18.2","version_number":"9.0.1+forge-1.18.2","changelog":"- Fixed crash if mods change player dimension during spawn\n- Fixed random nether portals being spawned in their expected Vanilla locations even if players are returned to their return portal","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-26T13:37:48.035252Z","downloads":4073,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9c3e940b99ef016a421b7511606a587825bd021b401ed9740b353fe35990d6998d330bdd1e48aff07e259de1cdaf8b2d2a2c58abf695b49075859024fa1fa4d9","sha1":"3b3b16105bc366578c5f469860ff2d6b376e9601"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nPZr02ET/versions/b11QoY35/netherportalfix-forge-1.18.2-9.0.1.jar","filename":"netherportalfix-forge-1.18.2-9.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":216459,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"RAATKbAN","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"wvv5zQj8","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"netherportalfix-forge-1.18.2-9.0.1.jar"},"mods\\morediscs-1.18.2-33-forge.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"b486edb6b500cb0f6579ca908c36029e029535f56fd1e6bb3ac903d81d39a47667fc727378aeb15b71d93d6d8ad473cc83b67a74bd6fcb5786aa39a55bf8fba2","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"pXYChc1a","slug":"more-music-discs","project_type":"mod","team":"D0JjyjB1","title":"More Music Discs","description":"Adds more music discs","body":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:center\">\n    <strong>\n        <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2CUh6gMuCt\"><img alt=\"Discord\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/1027252425960198165?color=5b6ee1&label=Discord&style=for-the-badge\"></a>\n        <a href=\"https://patreon.com/MarsThePlanet\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshieldsio-patreon.vercel.app%2Fapi%3Fusername%3DMarsThePlanet%26type%3Dpatrons&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon\" /></a>\n        <a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/phobos/\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fminecraft-server-status-badge.vercel.app%2Fapi%2Fserver%2Fphobos.mcserv.fun%3Fport%3D25565&label=anarchy server&style=for-the-badge\" title=\"phobos.mcserv.fun\" /></a>\n    </strong>\n</h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This mod adds music discs from youtube.

Engineering","description":"Retrofuturism, industry and multiblocks!","body":"### About\nImmersive Engineering is a tech mod with a certain charm, based on the ideas and concepts, and with most assets created by Damien Hazard.\n\n \n\nOverall, it's about realism-inspired technology:\nInstead of glowing red tubes, it offers actual, hanging powerlines.\nInstead of one block that magically spits out dusts when ore is put in, it offers a crusher, a big multiblock (5x3x3) that features rotating wheels and spits out particles as it breaks the ore.\nInstead of a Laser that turns power into magical light and ores, it offers an Excavator, another massive, resource intensive, multiblock (3x7x8) which digs ores out of the ground with a big rotating bucketwheel.\n\nIE is about making tech mods more balanced and more pretty, and adding its own twist by going for retro-futurism (think BioShock, Order 1886, SkyCaptain and the World of Tomorrow) rather than clinical white+grey future cubes.\n\n\nIt uses the Forge Energy API, known from just about every other tech mod, but it can be played fully standalone.

Block predicates notably got an any predicate.\n* Added helpers for reading a blockstate from JSON and writing a blockstate to JSON.\n* Changed fluid transfer logic to process JSON overrides before forge fluid API.

Probably. Worth it? Definitely! [Discord](https://discord.gg/VtNrGrs)\n\nHave you ever picked up a magic mod for Minecraft, and thought that it was too tame? Was there not enough danger involved when creating your next high-tech gadget? Bored with all of those peaceful animals just staring at you without a care in the world? Well then, I am glad you came here!  \n  \n\nBlood Magic is an arcane art that is practiced by mages who attempt to gather a vast amount of power through utilizing a forbidden material: blood. Even though it does grant a huge amount of power, every single action that is performed with this volatile magic can prove deadly. You have been warned.  \n  \n\nFor the best experience, you should install [JustEnoughItems](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) to find your way through the recipes.\n\n## Contact\nHave discord? We now have a server if you want to come chat with us! [Here's the link](https://discord.gg/VtNrGrs).\n\n## Getting Started\nGetting started in Blood Magic has changed slightly since 1.7.10. Rather than finding a Diamond to craft a Blood Altar, you need to obtain some Demonic Will. To get your first bit of Will, you'll need to craft some Soul Trumpets Snares and toss them at enemies. If you're lucky, this will snare the enemy. When killed, snared enemies will drop a small amount of their Will. I'll let you take it from there.\n\n## Documentation \nDocumentation is provided via an in-game book managed by [Guide API](https://modrinth.com/mod/guide-api-legacy) under the name \"Sanguine Scientiem\".\n\nIn 1.16.3+, the in-game book is instead managed by [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli)! Can confirm, it's naisu.\n\nIf you're playing in 1.12 and want a web-based guide, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLX9VgXOBSRBPyEptMprAJh_SE3W-zvXFGfDu-0m60Q/edit?usp=sharing). Big thanks to Tiyth at MinecraftGuides for putting it together.\n\nThere are web-based mirrors of the Patchouli guide for [1.16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOd63XVV79AE4w0Fb1zWWha737cGXbWUFoIHhtu9cw8/edit) and [1.18/1.20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfCuNDqDhFuXaDBbuxe9JvgB9XSszkoUvYRPft5jMhU/edit#heading=h.bkcie2978mal) here, respectively. \n\n## Art\nYou may notice the mod has an entirely different look than you may remember. These textures were graciously provided by the [Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity) team.\n\n## #Sponsored\nIn the market for a Minecraft server to play with some friends? Don't know how to set one up? Then consider renting an already configured server! \n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/2ad12511-1544-4298-959c-13a840b2653a.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/wayoftime)\n\nIf you click on the picture above and select a plan (recommended 6GB or higher for most modpacks), you can use my code **wayoftime** to get **25%** off of your first month! A small commission of the server goes towards my daily caffeine addiction, but I'd say only consider a purchase if you're already looking for a server!\n\n## Team\n\n#### **WayofTime**\n\nWay works on all the cool content you get to play around with. Can usually be found making a mess for Nut to clean up.\n\n#### **TehNut**\n\nNut is essentially a maid. He primarily works behind the scenes, making sure the codebase itself stays as clean and optimized as it can. He's also in charge of most of the work involved in porting to new Minecraft versions. Can usually be found committing code in the wrong bracing style.\n\n#### **Yulife**\n\nOne of the art people. Currently on an extended vacation.\n\n#### **CyanideX**\n\nAnother art person. Currently on sporadic vacations.\n\n#### **BBoldt**\n\nOur third art person. Currently on a permanent vacation.\n\n#### **VT-14**\n\nOne of the new members of the team. Works on the fancy rendering in the in-game guide, which makes the user's life a lot easier.\n\n#### **Wrincewind**\n\nThe other new member! Works on the content of the in-game guide and constantly updates it when I make arbitrary changes.\n\n## Additional information\n\nFor additional information, see the [MinecraftForum thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1290532-1-10-2-1-9-4-blood-magic-v2-1-0-65-updated-sept) or the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/mod/blood-magic/gallery).","published":"2023-09-08T19:46:56.364689Z","updated":"2023-10-02T20:50:54.833904Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":52754,"followers":56,"categories":["equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.2","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RHWtV7WV","J8Sb1lv3","FRIuggx6","eDpFP1aq","5lL8eoSC","YdoAfXVe","CAZNylAx","K66t3LGa","BngWxfXp","UJsTLp6J","P5H8510Z","ii9JKzUv","gNujuIyb","KitIGxc1","YJyU4oK2","4bmWYUJ8","ZtaBMbyg","oIKdCFMm","l7asfPgz","tTouQiUp","EWRKP5Z5","HKf8k8IP","hDzbUduo","Ll47gv5n","GrTyolpy","GbJd4Ot6","OzPm6fkD","7Zu5wh4m","ATE7861p","KwD7Yx7u","stzqLEB8","RhpbiCDl","MSoMVFnz","nBd9XPBa","fJHw6e6o","tUFmJlw8","tKfLwokW","k1aknywe","zNdLXvCW","2gop79L6","RmHetikK","opw4W2ed","CponSuiu","9ErYbCNZ","pZO7SitR","CN2IzYZY","VdFxMbWX","d4BQw8ml","KPrALD8D","kY3F2BsD","uvVxmBPR","H9X4kOOJ","fYs45YDQ","Z95SAAB8","Y1zZedTO","ISjdJRi9","FrM4rycO","bOVRt5OL","nnwgOnUq","8UQgQ7G7","Ji4NYwNA","oTNjRU1T","LQ4v6pTS","68PjJecg","1eE3f67W","A7Q6hSRn","XGr2mnug","LNEc0bdD","6FKpnabS","V4sQz6kX","Us4Xm3XG","cg7MaZKz","FS61G2Lx","friNu5Lh","L51sD8IB","BsUmjGLu","5Wah7wmt","lyyYnTc2","VZHnxiTm","YBkUeiQW","PD5E4KSD","yNG0bLPp","X3PFcgoy","G4iYKHZy","SMb6Twzr","OvvS8Mgy","kmy6rPsD","cb6o6Eq8","VYJbifoQ","nOLvBDJ1","ruj8EP2y","ejBWZDEa","IC3d48vd","PwEhftHy","rsJ7C5Sy","5e3iWkIB","RoEUfzXV","yQoyAoi0","pDHXdUSI","xu1VgR0y","VuTD225e","sAMx7oa0","uZTNUokr","tKZIVR8T","bPLpo9dI","AfsYB9lo","5BlulgDO","WKkurFWl","2CIuZygx","XGEIJWdp","tPyFSrSJ","7Ro7J109","9IRh5w4N","BNMVivU1","O04ppeXy","7HxKZLDl","CyM0kR9Z","V2vlexIp","STN1fmPG","8btjXmcT","BPmIJ7Gx","NwmqDJN3","G01XBOLS","cqvrhWdZ","kdCJGnDS","jxoVgwYd","KQo1SKFY","Iu8YeUSI","8x6c9ouc","Hyn44fHJ","UdnzPppM","GMLrIukd","GKa8Q35O","lagzDiOS","ZDeaTBMZ","riFrJREI","YJnMeDev","k0glNwcf","NlLLm0mc","YZe8I31Z","eHzvvDZd","yoFaqlB8","x7WSA1ox","bmUYP45D","GtMIuGOR","EIfCCjTV","l1rv9D8D","sNtJkPuj","GU2ugrvh","HNlePk2w","6NUrENXk","gWl0bqMV","kdAfe1sa","nuiro8Sg","pzyijacJ","tHOd5trS","Nmw1Zs60","UbFLpwDf","5wtqCfA3","FcuOxrUU","VtjGMLY9","iuU2pnAL","22S7kRJK","Vkw6iuHa","InO0Os3P","b73UZ2R9","6D9lsJNQ","vCZrHEKc","bta18uAt","1eygylyc","O059qIY6","xml41LtX","PC6E2bcI","ca9xYZXA","wuMao28u","cNDVGrJz","7Mg53Sit","9OUJc8lt","KFYCrtLV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PbNc6qBY/4662cc0de2f217742fe0b257ed9398244d9e298a.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"cNDVGrJz","project_id":"PbNc6qBY","author_id":"GVFjtWTf","featured":false,"name":"BloodMagic-1.18.2-3.2.6-41","version_number":"1.18.2-3.2.6-41","changelog":"<p>------------------------------------------------------<br>Version 3.2.6<br>------------------------------------------------------<br>- Changed Sigil of Holding rendering so that it displays the selected Sigil in the hand.<br>- Added a new music disc, which is obtainable in the Mines!<br>- Modified several textures, and adjusted Reinforced Runes' recipes accordingly.<br>- Fixed the Harvest Moon ritual so that it works properly with Netherwart.<br>- Modified the recipe framework of the Mark of the Falling Tower to better facilitate creating custom recipes.<br>-&gt; Now includes fluid support!</p>\r\n<p>- Added Patchouli documentation for The Rhythm of the Beating Anvil ritual (Autocrafting Ritual).<br>-&gt; Sorry it took a while.

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- -

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly.

The scrolling can occur from any corner to any other corner of the texture, even diagonal!\nHere is an example of a conveyor belt:\n\n<img width='300' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/p19vrgc2/images/3dcde0711f815f3d20c9abc9d27b7af758816665.gif' alt='Scrolling texture conveyor example'>\n\n \n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## 🧊 Model types\n\n### Connected model\nConected models are models which will connect to other blocks when used in conjunction with the connected texture type. Connections can be specified for specific blocks and states.\nHere is an example of an oak tiles block which connects to itself and acacia tiles:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n\n```json\n{\n   ...\n   \"type\": \"connecting\",\n   \"connections\": [\n      {\n         \"type\": \"is_same_block\"\n      },\n      {\n         \"type\": \"match_block\",\n         \"block\": \"acacia_tiles\"\n      }\n   ]\n   ...\n}\n```\n\n</td><td>\n<img width='500' src='https://imgur.com/AoSdjrP.gif' alt='Connected model example'>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## 📐 Block overlays\nUsing the features provided by the connecting model and connecting texture type, you can also achieve block overlays!  \n<img width='600' src='https://imgur.com/I6Whhhe.gif' alt='Sand overlayed on gravel'>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n## FAQ\n### Can I use Fusion in my modpack?\nYes, you are allowed use Fusion in your modpack\n### Do I need to install Fusion on the server?\nNo, Fusion is only required on the client and does nothing when installed on a server\n### Why does Fusion not work with Sodium?\nSodium ignores the Fabric rendering api. To solve this install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium).\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/gZDWWY6.png)\n\n### Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Cultivation\" - a collection of farming and food related things to make your world more agrarian and delicious!\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-crafting\">Extended Crafting</a>, and it adds the ability to automatically craft items made using Extended Crafting's crafting tables more easily. This mod is designed to be able to run without Applied Energistics 2, but installation with it is recommended.</p>\n<p>This mod adds many crafters. To use them, put one next to an Unpackager, and have the Unpackager handle respective crafting recipes, which can be encoded into recipe holders with the Encoder. The Ender and Flux crafters requires their respective Alternators, and the Combination crafter requires a sufficient amount of Marked Pedestals. The crafters, when connected to a ME Network, will automatically eject outputs into the network.</p>","published":"2024-02-15T15:41:59.988417Z","updated":"2024-03-14T20:48:42.030146Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":180,"followers":0,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["XBI4v3j6","oHi6gXxT","sqFUilsc","B9Prlm2g","hcuDSp9H","Jjo18jEg","Ei2UjlME","WV22EWYk","NAQNSprG","MXU3ARCi","8uAJc55A","FCAn1uMG","vtDan4e0","pFVczz82","uH2xvIsr","SvpS4OOK","GsW7c7cP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qO33ACjS/a38867e4908ba9d8ed4294957794f882c84b8b81.png"},"version":{"id":"uH2xvIsr","project_id":"qO33ACjS","author_id":"dO4wxcIT","featured":false,"name":"1.18.2-3.1.0.19","version_number":"1.18.2-3.1.0.19","changelog":"Remove redundant tier check in basic recipe transferring  \r\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-14T20:47:39.603808Z","downloads":11,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0da4b9b697a01efdb2fef899f3e7da2be2e30b08","sha512":"bb2ca5360cf790a1fe7ff853c7608130cde8bd3a210072567d863ef858e0826879a7c3632c73424b05839a1a74d4bf74dae21c8b743ccc04bdfd88b91f24d94c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qO33ACjS/versions/uH2xvIsr/PackagedExCrafting-1.18.2-3.1.0.19.jar","filename":"PackagedExCrafting-1.18.2-3.1.0.19.jar","primary":true,"size":237462,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"821d36e5e61f25c21027fee1d6715dec98af63543625bdb09cde678377b7ea8908cfa5c2f0ac76293ccf39f3e8324fc5384d82487a12252ea599339dee288ad2","sha1":"7725b8762e691789f32ee247f586775fa6b0f150"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qO33ACjS/versions/uH2xvIsr/PackagedExCrafting-1.18.2-3.1.0.19-sources.jar","filename":"PackagedExCrafting-1.18.2-3.1.0.19-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":158730,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ugIdhQx4","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5JMG1gql","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"7JNXWkEQ","user":{"id":"dO4wxcIT","username":"TheLMiffy1111","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6522061?v=4","bio":"Add a bio","created":"2021-11-23T19:32:47.085957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PackagedExCrafting-1.18.2-3.1.0.19.jar.disabled"},"mods\\industrial-foregoing-1.18.2-3.3.1.6-10.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"84e51adeee6e3ddfb83e662de912e419ee4e32f3b5c70e1521660bdf8e3530fd665d8d86008cab55423291f2177ef6524c0f3adfe56fbdfbcc8bf57ba0c97a13","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lWxpUd04","slug":"industrial-foregoing","project_type":"mod","team":"O2aWK6LQ","title":"Industrial Foregoing","description":"A collection of machines to make your minecraft builds easier to automate","body":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YSXHWf5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"104\">&nbsp; <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/titanium\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/dependency-titanium-E04E14?labelColor=2D2D2D&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"\" width=\"197\" height=\"28\"></a>&nbsp; <img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/266515.svg?badge_style=for_the_badge\" alt=\"\" width=\"445\" height=\"28\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Buuz135mods\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Buuz135mods?color=E04E14&labelColor=2D2D2D&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"28\"></a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/buuz135\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/DONATE-PATREON-E04E14?labelColor=2D2D2D&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"\" width=\"159\" height=\"28\"></a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://discord.gg/4tPfwjn\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/357597633566605313?color=E04E14&labelColor=2D2D2D&label=JOIN DISCORD&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"\" width=\"227\" height=\"28\"></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Industrial Foregoing</strong> is a mod that allows you to automate most of minecraft's functions.

1.18.2+\n\n![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n![Github Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n[![This is a Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original-orange)](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot)\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a optimization mod and unofficial fork of Smooth Boot for Minecraft Forge 1.18.2+, If you have a PC with a older or lower end CPU (ex. CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2024-01-08T01:33:06.845232Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":162913,"followers":134,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW","gCz8FYyg","FzbfQajL","HkfL3iGO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"gCz8FYyg","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.4 for MC 1.18.2","version_number":"mc1.18.2-0.0.4","changelog":"This update uses a specific amount of main worker threads you can change it in the config, while the old updates uses the number of the available threads, resulting in worse performance.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T01:28:18.440655Z","downloads":6342,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3a761c4f8156a5c6669dc06bdf77703ec65499add02b8945c10a460e6801cbcc9aec991439326279ca79bdbcc44e1ef3b406663c87adc867bccfe927ce7334d9","sha1":"89d7daf594d25c39eebac0e90f72f43c69b52dfe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/versions/gCz8FYyg/smoothboot%28reloaded%29-mc1.18.2-0.0.4.jar","filename":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.18.2-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":41005,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nBB8t1rq","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.18.2-0.0.4.jar"},"mods\\AdditionalEnchantedMiner-1.18.2-18.23.jar":{"sha512":"13701c894e68234bca3ab6c6f8712f752f25472d6169d0e69ba285295d37425fc56f8ab17b3659c6d1cd146a6144b0698aa131d0dcfbad87c9b68ae12f7ae76b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jhxX1zVW","slug":"additional-enchanted-miner","project_type":"mod","team":"JhxR5oEd","title":"Additional Enchanted Miner","description":"This mod adds some miners like BC's quarry.","body":"This mod adds some advanced miners which can have enchantments.\nIt allows automatically collecting resources with Fortune or Silk touch.\nFluids are automatically removed by QuarryPlus with Pump Plus or Pump Module.

The mod provides JEI recipe handlers for other mods where otherwise absent. In addition to additional recipe handlers, it adds configurable tooltips which can provide insightful information for pack developers and tech-savvy players.\n\nJEI Integration is still in the development phase meaning some features of the original mod are not present. The configurable tooltips is currently the only implemented feature of the original mod. More coming soon™...\n\n### Tooltips\n\nTooltips are extremely helpful to pack developers, mod developers and players for providing the player with helpful insights about a particular block/item's traits. By default, JEI Integration tooltips come disabled as to allow you, the player or pack maker the control over what is shown and how.\n\nThe list of available tooltips is as follows:\n\n#### 1.18 and Above\n\n- **Burn Time** - Displays the number of ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) any burnable item in game will burn for.\n- **Durability** - Displays the durability of an item where applicable (e.g. tools, weapons, armour, etc). The tooltip shows both total durability and remaining durability.\n- **Enchantability** - Displays the enchantability of an item where applicable (e.g. tools, weapons, armour, etc.)\n- **Hunger/Saturation** - Displays both the hunger and saturation values that the particular food item will restore. (As of version 3.1.0.)\n- **Max Stack Size** - Displays the maximum stack size of an item - usually 64, but in some cases, like ender pearls, it's 16.\n- **NBT Data** - Displays all NBT data stored on a block/item e.g. enchantments.\n- **Registry Name** - Displays the block/item's internal ID, registry name or namespace name (e.g. minecraft:apple). While already available in the game (using `f3+h`), JEI Integration gives players more options as to how it appears in the tooltip.\n- **Tags** - Displays the tags for a given block/item. E.g. forge:storage_blocks, minecraft:planks. (As of version 3.1.0.)\n- **Translation Key** - Displays the translation key for a given block/item. E.g. block.minecraft.stone. (Useful for mod translators.)\n\n#### 1.15 and Above\n\n- **Burn Time** - Displays the number of ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) any burnable item in game will burn for.\n- **Durability** - Displays the durability of an item where applicable (e.g. tools, weapons, armour, etc). The tooltip shows both total durability and remaining durability.\n- **Hunger/Saturation** - Displays both the hunger and saturation values that the particular food item will restore. (As of version 3.1.0.)\n- **Max Stack Size** - Displays the maximum stack size of an item - usually 64, but in some cases, like ender pearls, it's 16.\n- **NBT Data** - Displays all NBT data stored on a block/item e.g. enchantments.\n- **Registry Name** - Displays the block/item's internal ID, registry name or namespace name (e.g. minecraft:apple). While already available in the game (using `f3+h`), JEI Integration gives players more options as to how it appears in the tooltip.\n- **Tags** - Displays the tags for a given block/item. E.g. forge:storage_blocks, minecraft:planks. (As of version 3.1.0.)\n- **Translation Key** - Displays the translation key for a given block/item. E.g. block.minecraft.stone. (Useful for mod translators.)\n\n#### 1.14\n\n- **Burn Time** - Displays the number of ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) any burnable item in game will burn for.\n- **Durability** - Displays the durability of an item where applicable (e.g. tools, weapons, armour, etc). The tooltip shows both total durability and remaining durability.\n- **Max Stack Size** - Displays the maximum stack size of an item - usually 64, but in some cases, like ender pearls, it's 16.\n- **NBT Data** - Displays all NBT data stored on a block/item e.g. enchantments.\n- **Registry Name** - Displays the block/item's internal ID, registry name or namespace name (e.g. minecraft:apple). While already available in the game (using `f3+h`), JEI Integration gives players more options as to how it appears in the tooltip.\n- **Translation Key** - Displays the translation key for a given block/item. E.g. block.minecraft.stone (Useful for mod translators)\n\n#### 1.12 and below\n\n- **Burn Time** - Displays the number of ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) any burnable item in game will burn for.\n- **Durability** - Displays the durability of an item where applicable (e.g. tools, weapons, armour, etc). The tooltip shows both total durability and remaining durability.\n- **Max Stack Size** - Displays the maximum stack size of an item - usually 64, but in some cases, like ender pearls, it's 16.\n- **Metadata** - Displays an block/item's metadata e.g. orange wool has metadata 1.\n- **NBT Data** - Displays all NBT data stored on a block/item e.g. enchantments.\n- **Ore Dictionary Entries** - Displays all ore dictionary entries for a given block/item e.g. logWood\n- **Registry Name** - Displays the block/item's internal ID, registry name or namespace name (e.g. minecraft:apple). While already available in the game (using `f3+h`), JEI Integration gives players more options as to how it appears in the tooltip.\n- **Translation Key** - Displays the translation key for a given block/item. E.g. block.minecraft.stone (Useful for mod translators)\n\n### Configuration\n\nJEI Integration offers a great deal of customisation to the player in the form of configurations. Configurations can be altered via the in-game menu or the configuration file (Stored in `./minecraft/config`).\n\nThe mod provides the following options for when a tooltip is displayed for an item:\n\n- **Disabled** - The tooltip is not displayed.\n- **Enabled** - The tooltip is displayed all the time.\n- **On Shift** - The tooltip is only displayed while the user is holding the left or right shift key on the keyboard.\n- **On Debug** - The tooltip is only displayed while the `advancedItemTooltips` option is enabled (`f3+h`).\n- **On Shift & Debug** - The tooltip is only displayed while the previous two conditions are true (On Shift & On Debug).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can you make this for Minecraft version x?\n\nJEI Integration supports Minecraft 1.10+ that Forge has support for. It will not support snapshots or older versions of the game e.g. 1.7.10.\n\n### Can you make JEI Integration for the Fabric mod loader?\n\nJEI Integration is, and always will, be made for Forge.\n\n### Should I download your mod from other websites?\n\nJEI Integration downloads are only available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei-integration) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei-integration). Downloads found elsewhere are not legitimate and are most likely dangerous to use.\n\n### Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n\nOf course! Put me in all the packs.\n\n### When are we going to get new features?\n\nSoon™\n\n### I found a bug or want to request a feature, where do I do it?\n\nGitHub. Links at the top of this page.\n\n### Why?\n\nBecause.\n\n## Release Notes\n\nRelease Notes (or changelogs) for JEI Integration generate automatically using Git commit messages and can be found under the [files tab](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei-integration/files) on CurseForge.\n\n## Join our Discord\n\nOur Discord community is a great place to chat with others and get insight on SnowShock's latest mods and packs.

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-03-12T04:00:57.889040Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":459029,"followers":267,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"sVuCrC2E","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-1.18.2-5.0.9.2","version_number":"1.18.2-5.0.9.2","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

variables can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi` \n    - via a `FloatSupplier` for simple number variables \n    - via a `BooleanSupplier` for simple boolean variables\n    - via a custom variable factory if your variable requires more complex logic, such as reading complex variable names or giving different results for different contexts\n  - functions can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi`\n    - via a `Function<Float, Float>` for simple functions witn 1 argument\n    - via a `BiFunction<Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 2 arguments\n    - via a `TriFunction<Float, Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 3 arguments\n    - via a `Function<List<Float>, Float>` for functions with a variable amount of arguments provided via a List<Float>\n    - via a  custom function factory if your function requires more complex logic, such as reading the argument strings as a value other than float\n- changed the `unknown model printing` option to `Model exporting` and added options to export all models info to a .jem file or the log, not just the unknown / modded ones\n  - Models now export `Blockbench` ready with correct pivots, boxes, and uvs.\n  - models now export to `.minecraft/emf/export/`\n- implemented `is_on_head`, `is_in_hand` & `is_in_item_frame`, which did nothing before\n- fixed a `\"newstate\" is null` crash\n- added the `Animation LOD distance` setting which allows you to set the distance at which EMF will start skipping animation frames to save performance\n- added the `Retain LOD at low fps` setting which will proportionally reduce the impact of the above LOD setting while the game is running at below 60 fps, as skipped frames can become more noticeable at lower fps\n- reworked the config screen to use sliders where appropriate\n- added `wolf_armor` to the OptiFine name mappings\n- invalid texture overrides will no longer cause the model to fail to load but instead log an error and use the vanilla texture\n- EMF log messages are now prefixed with a shorter `[EMF]`\n- temporarily disabled texture overrides with tridents as they are broken and difficult to troubleshoot\n- added debug render option `Wireframe over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time\n- added debug render option `Wireframe flashing over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time but the wireframe fades in and out\n- emf now correctly reads all texture overrides with the various relative paths set by optifine e.g. `./`, `~/` etc\n- added a config setting *(enabled by default)* that allows EMF to modify the `enhanced block entity (EBE)` mod's config to disable it for block entities that have custom EMF models loaded\n- fixed texture overrides acting weird with feature renderers *(fixes Ewan's entity health bars cem models with villagers)*\n- added `left_ear` & `right_ear` to `head_piglin.jem` which seems to be correct but missing in OptiFine's documentation :/\n- reduced and reworded some of the loading log spam that would worry users *(for example Fresh Animations 1.9 now sends no log errors on load)*\n- added EMF only rotational logic functions for radians and degrees `wrapdeg() wraprad() degdiff() raddiff()`\n  - the `wrap` functions will wrap a rotation value down to it's smallest identical value, e.g. `wrapdeg(370)` will return `10` & `wrapdeg(350)` will return `-10`\n  - the `diff` functions will return the resulting difference between two rotation values factoring in the rotation, e.g. `degdiff(10, 350)` will return `-20` & `degdiff(10, 370)` will return `0` \n- added very many EMF only interpolation animation functions\n  - `catmullrom() quadbezier() cubicbezier() hermite() easeinoutexpo() easeinexpo() easeoutexpo() easeinoutcirc() easeincirc()  easeoutcirc()  easeinoutelastic()  easeinelastic()  easeoutelastic()  easeinoutback() easeinback()  easeoutback()  easeinoutbounce()  easeinbounce()  easeoutbounce()  easeinquad()  easeoutquad()  easeinoutquad()  easeincubic()  easeoutcubic()  easeinoutcubic()  easeinquart()  easeoutquart()  easeinoutquart()  easeinquint()  easeoutquint()  easeinoutquint()  easeinsine()  easeoutsine()  easeinoutsine()`\n  - hermite & catmullrom have 5 args, the bezier's have 4, the rest have 3, and all are used in the same way as `lerp()` with the delta value being the first argument.\n  - this is a good website to get an idea on what most of these look like https://easings.net/\n- `e` variable added\n- fixes for a certain mixin causing crashes\n- EMF now supports modifying modded block entity models which use the vanilla block entity models separately from the vanilla ones\n  -

For example, this means that you can put an import bus on a chemical tank, export bus on a chemical tank, storage bus on a radioactive waste barrel, attach pressurized tubes to interfaces or use chemicals in crafting recipes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hTShq45.png)\n\n## Chemical cells\nApplied Mekanistics also adds 1k, 4k, 16k and 64k chemical storage cells. You can now store gasses in your ME Drives! Do however note that they don't support radioactive gasses!\n\n## Chemical P2P tunnels\nApplied Mekanistics adds Chemical P2P Tunnels for high-throughput chemical transfer. Simply right click any Mekanism chemical tank on a P2P tunnel to convert it.\n\n## QIO support for Storage Bus\nApplied Mekanistics also allows the Storage Bus to interact with the contents of a QIO frequency. Just place the storage bus on the side of a QIO Dashboard.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EMxQdXR.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sif07Mx.png)\n\n## Recipes\n\nTo create a chemical housing, you'll need to use Osmium ingots instead of Iron or Copper ingots\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wXzGjtU.png)\n\nThe housing can be combined with a cell component to craft a storage
